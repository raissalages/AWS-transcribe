 Alright, so there is a lot of different ways that you can connect to your EC two instance. So I just want to, in plain old text, go over the different ways we can connect and then in the labs, we'll go actually go ahead and do that. So the first is SSH client, this is the most standard way, the most common way that people know how to connect to virtual machines. And it's pretty straightforward. The idea is that you have a public and private key. And you use use that to use SSH in order to get into your remote virtual machine. How it's different on AWS is that you actually generate the public and private key on AWS for the default user, you download the public key, and then you utilize that to get into your instance. It's all obviously done on port 22, you have to make sure your security group has port 22 open in order to use SSH, you can after the fact go in and add other users and add keys, but generally you want to use that managed key pair that it was provides you then you have easy to instance connect. This is for short lived SSH keys controlled by I am policies. It works only with Linux and not with all instances. I don't know where exact limitations are. I generally rarely ever use this because I like sessions managers better. But it is a good in between between sessions manager and SSH client, because you get SSH keys, they're short lived. So you have better security than SSH clients. And you have better control over access because you have I am policies. You know, but you don't do everything within the sessions manager window, which is not as fun that you have sessions manager, this is a connection to Linux or Windows machine via reverse connection, or they call it it's like an out of bound connection. Not a networking person, I don't understand, I just know that it works. And the idea is that you do not have to open up a port. In order to connect to it, you do not have to open up security groups for this, you'll have you can use this with Windows, if you log into a Windows Server, it's going to log you into a terminal like experience with PowerShell. If it's Linux, it's going to be your standard bash shell. Again, you don't have to open up the ports can access can be controlled via I am supports audit trails of logins, you do have to attach the proper permissions in order to talk to sessions manager. But other than that, pretty easy. We have fleet manager remote desktop, I only noticed this because I was trying to connect to a Windows machine, I was having a hard time downloading the RDP file. And I actually didn't list it in here. But technically, you can download the RDP RDP file and log in the usual way. But the way that it provides you is the remote desktop via fleet manager. And basically it's RDP. But in your browser, super easy, super simple. You have EC two serial console, this establishes a serial connection giving you direct access for troubleshooting the underlying hardware. I don't really understand what to do with this because I'm not somebody that worked in data centers. But I can understand that if you really know your hardware very well and you logged in via the serial console, you'd have access to more stuff. Whereas the other methods are at the software level. This is when you want to deal with hardware issues. And there you go.
