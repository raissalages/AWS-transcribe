 So the idea of S3 object replication is when you basically make a copy of a object somewhere else. And the reasons why you might want to do this is to replicate objects while retaining metadata, replicating objects into different storage classes, maintaining object copies under different ownerships, keeping objects stored over multiple AWS regions, replicate objects every 15 minutes, sync buckets, replicate existing objects and replicate previously failed or replicated objects, replicate objects and fail over a bucket in another AWS region. So a lot of cases where you're doing object replication, there are a few options in S3 for this, and we will cover them all. The first is cross region replication. That's where you're copying objects from one region to another same region replication. This is where you're copying objects to another bucket in the same region by directional replication. This is where you replicated one place and back the other way. And then there's batch region replication. So a bunch of options. But of course, there's more to replication than just these four options as it can be based on time based on size of data, things like that. But I want you to know these four core methods of object replication so we can understand all use cases for AWS. Okay.
