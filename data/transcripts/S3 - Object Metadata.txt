 Let us talk about s3 object metadata. So first of all, what is metadata, it provides information about data, but not the content itself. Metadata is useful for categorizing organizing data, providing contents about data. And I want to point out that metadata is not a specific concept is just a general tech concept around storage, just as e tags and checksums are not a specific concepts. Amazon s3 allows you to attach metadata as three objects. Any time, we have two kinds, we have system defined and user defined. What's really interesting about this screenshot is generally system defined, you're not allowed to set the value as Amazon or AWS will set them for you. But there are a few exceptions for those content types, such as the content type of system defined, I need to point out that there are things that look similar to metadata, like resource tags and object tags. But those things, object tags, and resource tags are intended to provide information about cloud resources, and not the contents of the object, which is what the purpose of metadata is. So yeah, there's a bit of confusion there, but they're not the same. Let's go talk about the specific types of metadata.
