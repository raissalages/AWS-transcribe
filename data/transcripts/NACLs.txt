 network access controls, also known as knackles act as a stateless virtual firewall at the subnet level. And when we say that they're stateless, this means that they have both allow and deny rules. If that doesn't make sense right now, don't worry, as we will talk in more detail about stateless and stateful firewalls here shortly. When you create a VPC, it will always create a default knackle for you. That's very important to remember. knackles contain two different sets of rules. They have both inbound rules and outbound rules. So inbound is ingress. So traffic is entering the knackle and outbound rules is egress, it's traffic exiting the knackle. So there is an example here on the inbounds and outbounds tabs where you see rules with numbers, we'll explain the numbers here shortly. subnets are associated with knackles, a subnet can only belong to a single knackle. So there's also a tab for subnet association. The key difference between knackles versus security groups is that knackles have both allow and deny rules, where security groups only have allow rules. And with knackles, you could block a single IP address. And this is something you could not do with security groups. We will make emphasis of that last example, because that is the best way for me to remember the difference between the two. If we take a look here at the actual rules for knackles, the first thing is you're going to have a rule number, this is something that security groups do not have and only knackles do the number, it will determine the order of evaluation from lowest to highest, it's important to understand that that low is a higher priority than high. The recommended way of working with these numbers is to work in either 10 or 100. increments. The reason why is that if for whatever reason you needed a number in between, you've given your route yourself some room to work with. But you'll see a lot of times we'll doing 10s or 100s. And the highest number I still think is that 32,766. So you have a lot of room to work with, you can set a type of traffic, or set a custom protocol or port range, this is going to be the same as security groups, you can either allow or deny traffic for this rule, which groups do not have security groups only have allow rules. So you wouldn't even specify it. A use case here would be let's say we need to determine there is a malicious actor at a specific IP address that is trying to access our instance, so we can block their IP address. So just carefully looking at this diagram, the idea is that we can create a deny rule at a very specific IPv4 address. And we have a deny rule, just specifically for port 22. So they can't SSH, which we are describing there. So hopefully, that is very clear as a clear example. If we're creating knuckles, and we're going to use the it was CLI as examples here, the idea is that we would provide the VPC, we would have to create a knuckle entry rule. So very similar to what we saw in the UI screenshot where you are providing a cider block. If it if the rules and allow action, it's protocol, the rule number, the direction ingress being inbound traffic, we associate the knuckle to a subnet. So that is going to be another thing that we're going to want to do. But there you go, that is knackles.
