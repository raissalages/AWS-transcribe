 Alright, let's take a look here at visibility timeout, this is a period of time, messages will be invisible after they are read or consumed by an app to avoid being read and processed by other applications. The default is 30 seconds, the minimum is zero seconds, and the maximum is up to 12 hours, you can set the visibility timeout via the attributes there. So we have visibility timeout there, a message is hidden only after it is consumed from the queue. Pretty straight forward, so there you go.
