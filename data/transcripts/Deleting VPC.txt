 Let us talk about deleting a VPC because you're going to find that when you go attempt to delete a VPC, there are a bunch of other VPC components that have to be deleted before you can proceed. So there are security groups and knuckles, there are subnets, there are route tables, there are gateway endpoints, internet gateways, egress only internet gateways, if you're using them. And so you'd have to run all of these commands before you can delete your VPC. So you can see there's a lot of work to do that. However, when you delete a VPC, the database management console, it will automatically attempt to delete the resources for you. So yes, you are supposed to delete these all manually. But this is one of the conveniences of the console. And when I can, I always tried to delete the VPC in the console. Okay.
