 There is the kinesis producer library, the KPL, and it is a managed library AWS to let you publish data to the kinesis data stream. And it's located here on GitHub. I'm going to tell you, this thing is super hard to use, especially if you are not great at Java like I am. It does have examples, but you're going to be pulling out your hair getting this implementation to work. But imagine once this worked, it's not that big of a deal. So when you need to send multiple records per second, this is when you're going to be using KPL. When you need your producers to vertically scale by 100 times, when you need a producer that is highly efficient of underlying compute resources, when you're going to be using KPL. And so here is a very simple example of using the KPL. The most important thing I highlighted there is the add user record. So if you're careful looking at that, you can see that is how they, it's not called put records, it's called add user record for whatever reason. But yeah, I just found this to be extremely hard to implement, even with all the examples that AWS has. So if I do have a lab that has KPL, you should thank me for it because it's super hard to do. Okay. Can you see that?
