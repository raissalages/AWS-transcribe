 Alright, let's compare stateful versus stateless. And I'm going to tell you, this is something I always forget. You know, I'm 10 years in with AWS, at least. And I always get these backwards, I have no idea why I think it's because I'm from a developer background. So this IT networking stuff is not top of mind. So if you get it backwards, don't feel bad about it. But let's do our best to make it really clear. So we can have the best chance to remember this when we sit the exams. So stateless firewalls, like AWS, knackles are not aware of the state of the request. So that's why they're called stateless. They don't know anything about it. So in both directions, they'll treat you like a stranger and stop you both ways to do a rule check. Now, I use the word stop, to say, they will check to whether allow or deny, that's not a block, that's just a stop. So understand that I have this nice little graphic, and we have ourselves an EC two instance. And this EC two instance wants to go talk out to the internet. So it's going to make a request. And we'll call this request a so we can track the progress of the request. And it's originating from the server, that's the EC two instance, the virtual machine over here. And it's going to go over to the knackle and the knackle is going to say stop, we need to decide whether you're allowed to like, leave or not allow or deny. And so either passes that rule or it doesn't. Let's imagine that it is allowed to go out. Now on the internet side, it's going to send a response, it knows that the origin is still the server, it's over here on the right hand side. Okay, but it's coming back the other way. Okay, it's coming back with a response from that that specific request, and the knackle is gonna say stop. We don't know who you are. We're like, well, we're from the originating servers, like we don't care, we're going to check you. Anyone coming or leaving is going to get checked. So that's the example there. Now imagine a request is coming from the internet, it's trying to reach the EC two instance, it's going to get stopped. And then the EC two instance is going to send back something to the to that request as a response, and it's going to get stopped. So it just stops all directions. So hopefully that is crystal clear. And that's what makes it stateless. Let's take a look at stateful firewalls like AWS security groups, they are aware of the state of the requests. For SGs, they allow all outbound requests and responses for the requests that originated outbound are allowed back through. So I know that was a lot to say there, but we'll we'll break it down here and understand that different virtual firewalls work differently. So don't look at this and think all stateful firewalls work this way. It's just the way security group firewalls work. Okay. So the idea here is very similar. We have request a, so request a is going to be the one in yellow here. So this is originating from the server, and it's going to go out. And as we said, all outbound requests are allowed. So it's going to go and go out this way right out to the internet. And the internet is going to return a response. And the response is allowed back because it remembers that the response came from the EC two instance. So it's allowed to go out. Alright, so this one always if it goes out, it gets to come back in. Alright, now let's look at the other direction. So we have request B coming from the internet, just going to clean up here. This one here has to get stopped. It says, Are you allowed or not to enter, enter through the security group? If it is allowed, then the response automatically is allowed to go back out. Okay, so hopefully that is very clear. And you know, that's the best I can do there. But again, understand that security groups are the way they handle it is that particular thing. And if you want to know this little icon here actually doesn't exist, I made it because security groups don't have an icon. But I wanted to make a good representation. So if you care about look at the icon, look at the knuckle, the knuckle has these two lines. And it has these arrows pointing in. And so it's saying that they're going to stop them both ways. And then the one I made down here shows it only checks on entering for this one specific use case. Okay, so there you go. Let's take a look at No, that's it. Yep. See you next one.
