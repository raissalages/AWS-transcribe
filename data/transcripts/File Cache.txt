 Amazon file cache is a high speed cache for data sets stored anywhere and a accelerate cloud bursting workloads. This thing kept coming up in different services. And so I figured we should just have a slide in it to cover it. So we have a general idea what it is. Amazon file cache is found under the Amazon FSx Management Console, I was really having a hard time finding this. And then I found out that it was somewhere somewhere else which was in FSx. So we'll continue on here serves as a temporary high performance storage location for data that is stored in on premise file systems, AWS file systems, Amazon S3 buckets, makes dispersed data sets available to file based apps on AWS with a unified view at high speeds sub millisecond latencies and high throughput. And so file cache is accessible to EC2, ECS and EKS compatible with most popular Linux based AMIs integrates with AWS batch via AWS EC2 launch templates integrates with AWS thinkbox deadline. Thinkbox deadline is for creative studios that's that do scale rendering workloads. There you go. Okay.
