 Hey, this is Andrew Brown and we are taking a look at the AWS transfer for SFTP. So the AWS transfer family offers fully managed support for the transfer files over SFTP, as to FTPS and FTP into and out of Amazon s3 and EFS. So what are all these protocols? Well, the first one is file transfer protocol. This is an early network protocol without encryption used for transferring files over a network. Then we have the secure version of it, which uses SSH, then we have FTP s, which extends FTP with the support of TLS. Then you have a s two. And so yeah, there's a lot of protocols, the common ports for these protocols, that'd be port 2421. For SFTP, this is port 22. FTPS, port 990, a s 2443. So yeah, there's a lot of stuff going on here.
