 Hey, this is Andrew Brad, we're taking a look at AWS batch, which plans schedules and executes your batch compute workloads across the full range of AWS compute services that can utilize spot instances to save money. We have a few components here we have jobs, job definitions, job queues, the job scheduler. By default, the scheduler uses first in first out, you can run batch on EC two Fargate Eks, it can handle an array of jobs, it can handle multi node parallel jobs, it can handle GPU jobs, and you can have GP job dependencies. Now, can I just say something about the service because I really wanted to do a lab on this. Because the service has been around for a long time. And I just they never required you to ever make a lab. And so I thought, okay, in this refresh, I'm gonna make a lab on this. And I could not believe how junk of a service this thing is, I could not get it to work, there was no information on on how to how to get it to work. I'm sure I could have got to work if I went out to Inaba support. But we will learn how it works. We have a lab here even though we don't succeed at the end, but we go through all the components of it. And so you can see for yourself the frustration I'm having with the service, but we will understand it for exams. Okay.
