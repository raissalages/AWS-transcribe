 So we said that cloud watch log insights supports any kind of log file. And the way it does this is through discovering fields. So when cloud watch insights reads a log, it's going to analyze the log events and try to structure the content by generating fields that you can then use in your queries. So cloud watch log insights inserts an at sign symbol at the start of a field that it generates. And it has five system fields that will always always be generated no matter what type of log it is reading from. And so we have messages the raw on parts log event, we have timestamp, this is the event timestamp contained in the log events timestamp field, we have ingestion time, this is the time when the log event was received by cloud watch logs, we have a log stream, this is the name of the log stream that the log event was added to, we have log, and this is a log group identifier in the form of account, hyphen, ID, colon log group name. And then we had the systems fields. But let's look at the actual fields that automatically discovers from different services that use cloud watch logs. So if you're using Amazon VPC flow logs, we're going to get these ones, if we're using Ravi, three, we're going to get these ones, if you use it was lambda, we're going to get these ones, if we're using it was cloud trail, we're going to get these ones. But notice that we're gonna have to look at the full list. And I believe do I believe we do look at this. But cloud trail has a lot of information there. So we'll have to see what it actually pull from it. Then we have JSON logs. So these are these the fields of a JSON log will just be turned into fields. And for any other types, it that it cannot discover, you can just parse the command to extract and create a ferial fields that uses in the query. So there you go. Oh, just one more thing here, I just want to show you what it looks like. So when you use a log, if you click on fields, you can see all the discovered fields there. And then you click on them, it'll just add it into the query for you. So there you go.
