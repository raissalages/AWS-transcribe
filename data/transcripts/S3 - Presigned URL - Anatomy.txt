 Alright, let's take a look at what the presign URL looks like. So I've broken it up into multiple lines to make it easier to read, as there's a lot going on here. As you can see, we have the algorithm that is being used. I don't think there's any other kind of signing algorithm. But if there was, you could swap it out there. Then we have temporary credentials. So these are not long live credentials. They're obviously short lived, because they're going to expire after a certain amount of time, the date to which the signature was created, the expiry in seconds. So here is going to last for 300 seconds indicates the part of the signing process of here, it's suggesting that it's in the host. And then we have the generate signature, which we're not actually showing here, we just have some placeholder text. But hopefully that makes it really clear on what is going on in this big, big URL. Okay.
