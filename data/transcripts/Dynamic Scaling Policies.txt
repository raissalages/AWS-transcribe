 Alright, so dynamic scaling policies are how much is to change capacity, and policies are triggered by cloud watch alarms. And if you only use this via the AWS Management Console, they abstract a bunch of this away. So you wouldn't realize it's so easy to configure these things and understand them when you're working with them via the CLI. But anyway, there are three types of dynamic scaling policies, we have simple scaling policies, step scaling policies, and target tracking scaling policies. And the idea here is that we'll have these adjustment types that will determine how capacity should change. So we have one called changing capacity. So change capacity based on the scaling adjustment, exact capacity change capacity to an exact number, percent change in capacity change capacity by a percentage. I need to point out that adjustment types are for simple and step scaling target tracking is doing it a little bit differently. But this will make sense as we go into the three types of dynamic scaling. Okay.
