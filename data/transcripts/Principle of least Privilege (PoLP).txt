 Principle of least privilege. PLP is the computer security concept of providing a user role or application the least amount of permissions to perform an operation or an action. And the way we can look at it is that we have just enough access. So JEA permitting only the exact actions for the identity perform a task and then we have just in time J it permitting the smallest length of duration and identity can use permission. So usually when we're talking about PLP, it's usually a focus on here. But now, these days, there's a larger focus on J it as well. And so JT is the difference between having long lived permissions or access keys versus short lived ones. And the most progressive thing in PLP is now risk based adaptive policies. So each attempt to access a resource generates a risk score of how likely the request is to be from a compromised source. So the risk score could be based on many factors such device user location, IP address, what service is being accessed and when did they use MFA, did they use biometrics, things like that. And right now, as of this time, it does not have a risk based adaptive policies built into I am you can roll your own. What's interesting is Cognito has risk based adaptive policies, they call it like adaptive authentication, but that's for user pools and not identity pools. user pools is for getting access to an app that you built through an IPD where identity pools and Cognito is about getting access to AWS resources. So you know, I'm sure he will get it eventually, but they just don't have it right now. And you have to rely on third party identity solutions to get risk based adaptive policies. Now talking about just enough access and just in time just in time is like you think how would you do that with AWS, you just add or remove permissions manually. Well, one thing you could do is use something like console me. So this is an open source Netflix project to self serve short lived I am policies. So an end user can access it as resources while enforcing j EA and j it. And so there's a repo there as well. But the idea is they have like this self serve wizard. So you say I want these things and then the machine decides, okay, you can have them or you you don't need them. And it just frees you up asking people and worrying about the length and stuff like that. Okay.
