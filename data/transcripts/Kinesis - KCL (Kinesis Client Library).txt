 kinesis client library. And by the way, I think it should have been named the kinesis consumer library. And often I'll call it that because I'll keep thinking that the C is for consumer but it's actually for client is a Java library that makes it easy for developers to consume data from kinesis. You might be thinking easy, it's written in Java, that can't be easy. But the great thing about this thing is that the KCL leverages something called multi Lang Damon, and allows you to basically use the binaries of Java underneath or something. I think that's what it's doing. So that you can leverage other languages like Ruby and Python. Could there be other languages like JavaScript or something else? Possibly, but I can only find Ruby and Python. So here's the Ruby example. And here's the Python example. If you see there, you have a record processor, and you just have to have very specific functions defined. So process records, lease loss, shard ended, shutdown requested. And then down below, they have this interesting code here. And so I'm assuming that this is what it's loading underneath, which is the maybe the Java code underneath because it's doing something there. So that's what I think it's doing. But yeah, that is the KCL. Okay.
