 the data stream CLI, and we will definitely utilize this in the labs for learning how to write and read to the Kinesis stream. The first is put record, and notice that the data has to be base64 encoded, so there we encode it, we're providing the partition key and the stream name. If you want to send multiple records, use put records. Then we have get records, and so this one's a little bit different because you had to get the chart iterator, and that's where I got a bit confused, like why do we need the chart iterator? Why can't we just read stuff? But you have to have the chart iterator, and then they have these iterator types, which I probably should have made a slide on, but the idea is that it depends on how much data you want. So it might be the last state or the last last record or whatever. So trim horizon is what we're going to end up using, you'll see in the lab, I'll drop it down, be confused by the names. But the point is, is that there is iterator types. So we have that. And yeah, so that will get records. So there you go. Okay, thanks.
