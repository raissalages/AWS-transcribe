 We're taking a look here at snowball edge. This is similar to snowgo snow cone, but with more local processing edge computing workloads, and device configuration options, they used to just be snowball, and then snowball edge came along, then snow cone came, and then they got rid of snowball because it was just to do a whole lot. The way you can identify this thing, it has those orange handles on it. So snowball edge features, we have an LCD display. So I'm assuming that is something like a Kindle or something embedded there, so that we have our ink thing to ship can use in a cluster or in a class can use in a cluster in groups of three to 16 nodes, which is kind of interesting, supports the data transfer protocols here. So nf, s, v, three, four, 4.1, s three over HTTP or HTTPS, there are five configuration or device configuration options. The first is the storage optimized for data transfer, the storage optimized, which has more usable storage, we have storage optimized with EC two compatible compute so that you can use compute on the machine. So it has compute with it, then you have compute optimized where it has 28 terabytes of dedicated NVM e SSD. So again, just depends on what your use case is. And then we have one where it has GPUs, which is the equivalent of one available instance type of a p three. So a much more powerful snow cone. But there you go.
