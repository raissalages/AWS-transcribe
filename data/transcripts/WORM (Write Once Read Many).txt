 What is worm? Well, worm is not what you think it is, it's not a bug in the ground, what it actually is, is write once and read many. And it is a source compliance feature that makes data immutable, meaning that you cannot change it once it's been written, you write once and the file can never be modified or deleted. But you may read it unlimited times form is very useful in the healthcare or financial industries where files need to be audited and untampered. In cloud, this is going to be in archival and object storage. So an example of a real world example of worm, not specific to cloud. But if you've ever played old video games, and you have those cartridges inside of them, they have chips. And inside there, there's a ROM and a ROM, you can write data to it once. And it's now permanent. And then you just read it many times when you want to play it. So there is a very practical example of worm. But yeah, we're setting that up to understand how worm will be used in cloud here. Okay.
