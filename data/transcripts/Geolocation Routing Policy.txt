 geolocation routing policies allow you to direct traffic based on the geographic location of where the requests originated from. So for example, this would let you route all traffic coming from North America servers, locate North America regions where queries from other regions could be directed to servers hosted in that region. So let's take a look at our code example, I'm going to get my pen tool out here. Notice it uses a set identifier to distinguish between these records as they both have the same name and type. Now we set the geolocation routing policy, each with their country code, and then we have our resource records down below. So hopefully you're starting to see a pattern in terms of how these things are configured, but it's not too difficult.
