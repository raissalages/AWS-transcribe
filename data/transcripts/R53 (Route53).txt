 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And we are looking at Route 53. So Route 53 is a domain name service DNS. And you can think of it as something like GoDaddy or Namecheap, but with integration specifically with AWS to make it a lot more powerful than these two. So what can you do with Route 53? Well, you can register and manage domains, create various record sets on a domain, implement complex traffic flows, continuous monitoring records with health checks, resolve VPCs outside of AWS. So let's say you need to have some resolution with your on premise stuff. This is all stuff that you can do. I want to point out one distinct thing that I noticed that Route 53 does that other clusters providers do not do, which is the ability to register domain. So if you were to go use Microsoft, you can't do that there. And then Google used to have Google domains, but they gave it away to Squarespace. So it's basically just AWS that is allowing you to still register domains directly. So that is really interesting. What could be a use case for using Route 53? Well, just when you want to route things. So the idea is that imagine you have incoming traffic into into your VBC through Route 53. Or anywhere, it doesn't necessarily have to be VBC. But generally, that's where it's going to be going. And so you can route traffic over to let's say an ALB. Or you can route traffic to an instance. As that, or you route traffic to an API gateway, or to CloudFront or an elastic IP. So there's a lot of places you can send your routing data. But we'll cover that in the upcoming slides here. Okay.
