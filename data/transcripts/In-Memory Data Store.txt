 Before we talk about last to cash, let's talk about caching and in memory data store. So caching is the process of storing data in the cache. So a cache is a temporary storage area. And the purpose of caches are to optimize for fast retrieval with the trade off of the data is not durable. So in memory data store is where data data is stored in memory. So think of RAM. And the trade offs of storing data in something like RAM is that it has high volatility, meaning that it's low durability, there's a risk of data loss, but access to the data is very, very fast. So often caches are stored in memory, they don't have to be but if you want to be fast, that's where they're normally going to be.
