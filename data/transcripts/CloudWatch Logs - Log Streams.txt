 looking at log groups and log groups contain log streams. So let's talk about what log streams are. So log streams represent a sequence of events from an application or instance being monitored. And you can create a log log streams manually. But generally, you don't have to do this, AWS will do it for you. But anyway, I just want to show you some examples of different log streams. And again, if you have a log group, you click in here, and this is what you would see. So for a lambda function, you can see that the the log streams are named based on the time it ran. And also it has like an ID on on the end of it on the end of it there. If you're looking at a log group for an EC two instance, what you're going to see is that it's going to make the log stream name just the instance ID. And if you were to use a divis glue, which is a service that uses cloud watch, it's going to name it based on the glue job. So the convention for log stream names is all over the place. But you can see certain services have certain conventions. But they can be whatever we want them to be. Okay.
