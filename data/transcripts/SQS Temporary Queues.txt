 temporary queues are high throughput cost effective application managed temporary queues when using common message patterns such as request response, temporary queue client written in Java lets you create lightweight queues that are deleted automatically when they are no longer in use. This is really interesting that I did not know that SQS could do, but using and that's just like a little part of the Java code. And by the way, this is not easy to implement, even though it has examples for it. But the idea of these benefit temporary queues is it serves as a lightweight communication channel for specific threads or processes can be created and deleted without incurring additional costs are API compatible with static, normal Amazon SQS queues. So basically what this is, it's like a like a like a like a mock version, in a sense of cloud SQS, but it's in your app. Okay. And so yeah, it's just it's just that okay.
