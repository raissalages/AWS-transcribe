 Let us take a look here at predictive scaling policies. This is when you trigger scaling by analyzing historical load data to detect daily or weekly patterns and traffic flows. You need a forecast of 24 hour cloud watch data before you can create a predictive scaling policy. predictive scaling policy will continuously use the last 14 days of data to tweak the policy. It will produce hourly forecasts for capacity requirements for the next 48 hours, it will update every six hours using the latest cloud watch data. So here's an example of you creating one does the policy type is predictive scaling, we're providing a configuration file. And it's going to just vary when we're either doing a forecast or if we are predicting. So if we first have to do a forecast, and so here we're saying, we're going to use the auto scaling group CPU utilization at the target group of 40. Okay, and it's set to forecast mode, or sorry, forecast only mode. And then when we actually want to utilize it, then we're going to set it as forecast and scale. So very similar. Obviously, this is a little bit harder to do a lab on because you'd have to wait a period of time. But there you go.
