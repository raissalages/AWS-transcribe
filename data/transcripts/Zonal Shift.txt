 Zonal shift is a capability in Amazon refugee three application recovery controller, also known as rough 53 arc, it shifts a load balancer resource away from an impaired AZ to a healthy AZ with a single action. So imagine you have a problem in AZA, it's going to make everything go over to AZB. So shifts are only supported on ALBs and ALBs with cross zone load bouncing turned off. Zonal shift isn't supported when you use ALBs as an accelerator endpoint in AWS global accelerator, you can start a zonal shift for a specific load balancer only for a single AZ you can't start a zonal shift for multiple AZs. I was very tempted to put this in the ELB section, but it's over here in the roughly three section because it is a roughity three feature. But very straightforward what zonal shifts are, but there you go.
