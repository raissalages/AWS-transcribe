 It was has a default VPC in every region. So you can immediately deploy instances. So here is an example from the console as it looks like today, as I'm sure they'll change it sometime in the future. But this is for the Ireland region. And if you notice, the default VPC flag says it's Yes. So that's pretty straightforward. A default VBC is configured by default with the following an IPV for cider block at the address 1723100. For it's less 16. I believe it's the same for every single region. If it's not, it's not that big of a deal. But I'm almost certain that it is. It has that Ford slash 16 on the end indicating the amount of IP addresses that are available to you. So there's about 65,500. Understand that this number is not exact, because there are reserved IP addresses that we'll talk about at some other point. But generally, that's how many you have, it's going to come with. For every single availability zone, there will be a subnet. So if you're in usc, one, which has six az, then there will be six subnets. And so those will be the size of Ford slash 20. And each of those subnets, if you're not familiar, Ford slash 20 will be about 4000 IPV for addresses, we have an internet gateway, we get a default security group, we get a default knuckle, we'll have default DHCP option sets, which you never have to play around with. But it is an option, we have route table that routes up to the internet gateway, you can delete a default VPC, you shouldn't, but we'll talk about that here in a moment. And it was recommends that you use the default VPC. Other clusters providers may recommend against using default VPC, such as GCP, they don't want you to use it, you're supposed to delete it, or not utilize it. But for AWS, there's no reason to delete your default VPC. If for whatever reason, you delete your default VPC, by accident, which happens a lot or intentional, you may want to recreate the default VPC. And you can run the following a CLI command, which is create default default VPC. And you'll get some output indicating that it's been created. Notice that it uses the 1723100. I'm not sure what would happen if you were to create, like delete the VPC, and then use that address and try to recreate it. I'm not sure if it would conflict on that. So that's an interesting use case. But it's not something that would ever show up in the exam, just something I'm thinking about. This command is only available via the CLI. So if you delete your VPC, you got to be comfortable with using the CLI here. Some other things I found out while playing around and discovering some stuff, you can you cannot restore a previous default VPC that you've deleted, you cannot mark an existing non default VPC as a default VPC. If you already have a default VPC in the region, you cannot create another one, there could only be one just like the movie Highlander. But there you go, and we'll see you the next one.
