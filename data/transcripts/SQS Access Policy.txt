 So we saw a back but did you know that you can have access policies to grant other principal permissions to SQS queue, just like how you have an S3 bucket and you can set a bucket policy, and access policy is basically the same thing. It's like an SQS queue policy, if you will, but it's called access policy. So here's an example of letting an SNS topic send messages to the queue. And I almost feel like this was a scenario in one of the labs, but I didn't exactly know it at the time. But but here it is now. We have common actions for send message, receive message, delete message, it's just a it's just like an I am policy. So you know, yeah, it is what you'd expect it to be here. Okay, but there you go.
