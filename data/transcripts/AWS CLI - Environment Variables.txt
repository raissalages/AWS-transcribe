 So for the CLI, we can set up environment variables, or what I like to call n bars to provide another way to specify configuration and credentials. And this is very useful for scripting, or temporarily setting a name profile as a default. So you are going to see me use environment variables a lot with able to see a lot in general, because when you're working with code, it is super useful. In terms of presidents, or what takes priority, it was CLI parameters are first environment variables are second and configuration files are third. So the idea is that the higher up in the list, they're going to override anything that's down below common environment variables for the able to lie that you absolutely will use on a regular basis is the eight of us access key ID, the eight of us secret access key, the default region, and the region and the profile. Those are the main ones. And often you will see me googling what they are because I can never ever, ever remember, no matter how many times I entered them in these two top ones, because they are horribly named. So whoever did that, I'm not happy with you. But it is what it is. There is a lot of environment variables, let's quickly go through them. And see if there's any interesting ones there. Throughout this section of the course, we do cover these for their specific ones, but we'll just cover them all in general really quickly here. So what we have is the CA bundle. This is for certificate bundles using HTTPS certificate validation, the auto prompt, we definitely like to use this one, this is a super useful one to turn on that, that wizzy wig. So it makes it easier to write CLI commands. There's four file encodings. If we need to change the location, the config file, if we need to provide additional directories, to check for modules, I believe that's for service models, I said modules, I'm going to say models, then there is the default output. So this would be changing from text to JSON to table, then there is the roll on, we use that when we are trying to assume a role. We have roll session name, if you want to name your session, your temporary session, that we have session token, this is for temporary STS, that we have shared credentials file, this is changing the location of the credentials file, we have web identity token file, this is used for auth 2.0. We have meta data disabled, this is for easy to instance metadata, when we want to disable the usage of it or the lookup of it. For credentials, I suppose, we have metadata service number attempts. So how many times you're going to attempt to retrieve credentials via an EC two instance, metadata service timeout, so number of seconds before connection to the instance metadata service should timeout max attempts pager, that's for pagination. And then we have the retry mode. So yeah, we cover these all over the place within this within the section. So you don't really have to memorize it. But again, just doing a quick overview. So you are aware of those environment variables.
