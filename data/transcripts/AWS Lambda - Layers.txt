 at lambda layers. The idea here is that you're going to pull in additional code and content in the form of layers. A layer is a zip archive that contains libraries, a custom runtime or other dependencies. You can use libraries in your functions without needing to include them in your deployment package, you can have up to five layers attached to a function, all layers can exceed the unzipped deployment package size of 256 megabytes, I believe that is still the limit, though, it might have might have changed. But that is you could you have your zip and there you have your layer. So here we have FFmpeg, pi number pi layers, very common ones that are there, I can't remember if it was has managed ones or not for you. But those are good examples of what you could have as layers. And the idea is that you can then utilize it in your runtime, the way you package the layer is going to vary based on language. That's why I'm not showing an example here. But we will, in a follow along, go ahead and set up a lambda layer and you'll see that process there. Okay. Let us take a look here.
