 Amazon Textract is an OCR service. So if you don't know what OCR is, it's optical character reader, and it will extract text from a scanned document. So when you have paper forms, and you want to digitally extract the data, Textract can OCR documents, so it will retain the layout coordinates, convert it to a table, detect forms, query against the you can also create a COCR data. So it'll take the data store it somewhere and you can query against it to find something maybe like a large document. It can also detect signatures, if you use the OCR expenses. So this is where it's specifically a model predefined to work with receipts. Then they have a predefined model for analyzing IDs like driver license, driver's licenses and passports. And then it has this really unique one for analyzing a lending or mortgage documents. I'm not sure why that is a specific model. But that seems to be one that they have built out. You can also have your own custom queries. So basically, this is custom models, train your own model with uploaded samples. Here's an example of the OCR expenses. So that that would be really good if you need to extract things out of a receipt. Here's an example of us using the analyze documents, I'm gonna get my pen tool out here. Okay. And so here you can see we have our file in s3, we're specifying the feature types. And that's going to return back the analyze data is very hard to work with a program automatically because it returns a bunch of objects. But yeah, Text Extract is a decent service. I evaluated it previously a couple years ago for one of my startups. But we ended up having to use like abio CR reader because it wasn't the best but I think this technology has greatly improved and this will work for many use cases. So there you go.
