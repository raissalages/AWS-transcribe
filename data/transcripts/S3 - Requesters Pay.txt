 Let's take a look at requesters pay this is a bucket option that allows the bucket owner to offset specific S3 costs the requester that's the person downloading the data. So as the bucket owner, you're still paying for the data storage fees, but the requester is now paying for the per request fees and the cost to download so the transfer fees. So when you want to share data, but not incur the charges associated with others accessing the data, examples of where you might use this, maybe for collaborative projects where you want the partners to pay, maybe it's client data storage, or you want the clients to pay, maybe it's shared educational resources where you where the institution doesn't want to pay the people, the researchers have to pay. Or maybe you're distributing content and you want again, the customers to pay. So mostly just when you want other people to pay. The way it works is you just turn it on anytime you like, it's really easy turning on or off. All requests must be now authenticated involving the requester pays bucket. requesters assume an IAM role before making the request. So we'll have an S3 request pair condition, anonymous access to the bucket is not allowed on buckets with requesters pay, which makes sense, since you want them to pay to access the bucket. And so the AWS account for the requester will be charged. So if we look here closely, we have a, a policy here. And so we're saying on the get and put for this bucket on all objects. And then we're just setting the requester pay to be requester so that we know that it's set for that. So yeah, there you go.
