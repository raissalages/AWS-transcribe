 let's take a look at cloud watch agent and the host level metrics. So some metrics you might think you're tracking by default for your c2 instance are not and requires you to install the cloud watch agent. Okay. And this caught me off guard, because when I spend up an EC two server, and then I was running out of storage space, I thought I would have that data, but I did not have that available to me. And I'll show you what I mean. So with host level metrics, and this is what you get by default, these are if you don't install the agent at all. So cloud watch, cloud watch metrics you're going to get is CPU usage, network usage, disk usage, it'll do status checks, okay, so the underlying hypervisor status and the underlying EC two instance status. So you know, you see those two checks for an EC two instance, that's what we're talking about. But agent level metrics, this is when you actually install the cloud watch agent, you're not going to get memory utilization, disk swap utilization, disk space utilization, page file utilization, and log collection. Okay. And so the cloud watch agent is able to collect a various amount of long. So if you had applications, logs, and other things that you install on your server, you need the cloud watch agent to do it. But I just really want to emphasize on the agent levels, the memory utilization and disk space. So like if you're wondering if you're running out of memory, or you're running out of disk space, you'd need the cloud watch agent. Okay, so there you go. So we just said that the cloud watch agent can collect
