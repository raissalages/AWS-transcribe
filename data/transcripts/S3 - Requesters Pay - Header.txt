 talk about requesters pay header. So every requester needs to pass along this x Amazon requester pair in their request header. So that's for delete, get head posts, and put requests, or as a parameter in a REST request. So here's an example of a curl command. And we're just pretending that we could do this with curl, we wouldn't normally do with curl. And we're just passing along it as a header. But generally, when you use the AWS CLI or SDK, it's going to automatically insert it for you. So notice here, I'm copying I'm doing pay requests requester. So that would automatically insert this header here. Same thing with the SDK where we're specifying it there. So hopefully that is clear how we're going to do that.
