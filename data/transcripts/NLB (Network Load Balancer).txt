 Let us talk about NLB. So it's designed to balance TCP and UDB traffic. It operates on the layer four of the OSI model. It can handle millions of requests per second while still maintaining extremely low latency. It can have global accelerator in front of it, just like ALB, to improve global availability. It preserves the client source IP. When a static IP address is needed for a load balancer, you can utilize it with this. The use cases here is high-performance computing, big data applications, real-time, and multiplayer gaming platforms. Financial trading platforms, IoT, and smart device ecosystems, telecommunications networks. The reason I know NLB is because I have a friend that worked for companies that built Roblox games for kids. I think one of the ones he worked on was pretending that you were in a high school. And so this thing just could handle the throughput for it. So when you need a lot of requests and a static IP address, then this is the one you're going to use, okay?
