 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And we are taking a look at Eva's global accelerator, which you can find optimal paths for from the end user to your web servers, global accelerators are deployed within edge locations. So you send you just traffic to an edge location instead of directly to your web app. I like to think of it as like a reverse CDN, because you are kind of doing the same thing where you're utilizing edge locations, but it's the user connecting and not you sending it to the edge location. So kind of in the reverse direction. There are two types of accelerators standard. So this automatically routes to the nearest healthy endpoint and custom routing where you're saying I want to route to this specific EC two instance, let's take a look at the components involved. So we have listeners, they listen for traffic on specific ports and send traffic to an endpoint group. So you have your endpoint groups. This is a collection of endpoints within a specific region. There is a traffic dial that can be used to change the percentage of the traffic between these, we have your endpoints, these represent a resource to send traffic to identity endpoint can be network load balancer, application load balancer, EC two instance, elastic IP, there's a global accelerator accelerator that has a speed comparison tool, which not that useful because you're not utilizing against your own your own app. It's just more like a general one to show you how fast it is compared to all the other regions. We'll take a look at this, the service was super easy to make a lab for. I wish we could have covered more on this just because I like the service, but there's not much to it here. And the lab will more or less explain this very clearly. Okay.
