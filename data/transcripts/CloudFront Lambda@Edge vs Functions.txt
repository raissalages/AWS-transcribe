 All right, let's compare directly platform functions and lambda edge because they're a little bit confusing. And they seem like they do the same thing, but they serve different purposes. So platform functions and lambda edge across the side here. So for platform functions, we have ECMA script 5.1 JavaScript. For lambda edge, we got node, yes, and Python for event sources. It's just request and response for the viewer. For lambda edge is both for viewer and origin request and response. The scale here is 10 million requests per seconds or more whereas lambda edges 10,000 requests per second per region. The function duration is sub millisecond for cloud front functions for lambda edge, up to five seconds, or up to 30 seconds. So you can see lambda edge is much slower. For maximum memory, we have two megabytes for cloud front functions. For lambda edge, we have considerably more memory that we can use for the max code size for cloud functions. It's super tiny 10 kilobytes for lambda edge, they can be one megabyte for the viewer or 50 megabytes for the origin network file system, network file system body request access, we do not have that for cloud front functions, but we do for lambda edge for geolocation data, geolocation data device, building and testing entirely within cloud front and function logging and metrics are all yeses for cloud front functions for lambda edge. For geolocation and device data, it's not for the viewer, but it is for the origin. You cannot do build and test entirely within cloud front. You do get logging and metrics for cloud front functions. There is a free tier available it's charged per request for lambda edge there is no free tier it's charged per request and function duration. Lambda edge is more expensive. Okay, I'm not listing the prices in here, but I'm just telling you it's more expensive. So generally, you'd want to use cloud functions when you can, for performance everything else unless there are specific reasons. This really will help visualize where these things are. Cloud front functions are at edge locations. Cloud cloud front lambda edges are at regional edge caches. And this diagram doesn't show it but technically, the viewer request would be on this side here. So we see origin requests, you have your request, it's just not in the diagram, and I didn't want to make a new one. So this is what it looks like. Okay.
