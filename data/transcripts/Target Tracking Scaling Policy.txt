 target tracking scaling policy automatically scales the capacity of your ASG based on a target metric value. So here we are defining a target tracking policy, I'm gonna get my pen tool out here. So see, it says target tracking scaling, and then we're providing a configuration file. And we're saying that we want to scale based on the predefined metric of ASG average CPU utilization. So when your CPU utilization goes over a target amount 50%, then it's going to trigger a scaling action. What kind of metrics could we use here? Well, we just saw SG average CPU utilization, we have average network in average network out request count per target. But if you want, you can use a custom metric, how you do that, I'm not sure. But the point is, is that they say you can target tracking scaling policy will create two cloud watch alarms, whereas simple and step scaling policy, you have to create this cloud watch alarms yourself, unless you're using database console, which can will indirectly create them for you. So it is nicer to set up tracks, tracking target tracking scaling policies, but yeah, does a different thing. Okay.
