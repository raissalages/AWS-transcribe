 Alright, let's talk about origin. So cloud front origin is the source where cloud front will send requests. And when you create your distribution, you have to specify the origin. So when you're utilizing the CLI, you're going to pass a configuration file to it for the distribution. And there's there's going to be a section for origins. And that's what we are going to set. So the main thing is that you're giving a domain name. So this is where the address of the origin that you want to point to, you can also supply a path. So that could be something prepended to the end of the URL, like forward slash, whatever you want. Depending on what your origin is, there is some configuration that can go that can be set on it. So for s3, as the origin, you have the s3 origin config for custom origin config, which will be for all the other possible possible origins, the configuration is going to vary there. So hopefully, that is pretty straightforward. When you're utilizing cloud front via the AWS Management Console, this configuration is a bit abstracted away from you. So it's nice to see this here so we can see exactly what is going on. Okay.
