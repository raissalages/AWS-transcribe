 Let's take a look here at MQTT, which stands for MQ telemetry transport. So MQ probably stands for messaging queue, or something like that. It is a lightweight pub sub messaging protocol MQTT uses minimal network bandwidth and often use an Internet of Things or real time messaging apps suitable for machine to machine communication where you really need minimal bandwidth used. The idea is that you have publishers, they will send messages to your broker, and then you have subscribers that will pull things in there. To publish or subscribe, you use the MQTT client. Similar how with other ones, you use a client basically for any kind of other protocol, you're always using a client, but sometimes there's like an API protocol you can connect with. But anyway, here in this case, we're using a client. And then we'll have to set a topic. So here's an example of using MQTT and Ruby. So it's very straightforward. And then here is an example of a subscriber. So yeah, very straightforward, extremely standardized. So yeah, there you go.
