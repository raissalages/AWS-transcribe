 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And we're taking a look at the aid of a CLI. And I think that we should ask what a CLI is first. And so a CLI stands for the command line interface, which is for processing commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. So the idea is we have operating systems that implement a command line interface in a shell. So there are a few terms you're going to hear terminal console shell. And I want you to know that these terms, they do mean a very specific thing, but they get abused all the time. So you're going to hear them in different contexts, where they're going to mean different things. But for what we're talking about this programmatic thing there, they mean very specific things. So a terminal is the text only interface. It's basically the environment we're going to be inputting and getting output. Okay, then you have a console, a console is a physical computer physically to physically input information into a terminal. And you might be remembering that there's a thing called the AWS Management Console. And the reason why that's confusing is the console is sometimes used to describe web browsers that have web applications that interact with programs. Okay, so but the real definition is the console is a physical computer to physically input information into a terminal, then you have the shell. So a shell is the command line program that uses the users interact with to input commands. Popular shell programs are bash, zsh PowerShell, there's another one called fish, there's a few of them. So when you look at this kind of graphic, you usually think of terminal console shell intermixed here. So like when I say terminal or console shell, we're generally thinking about this kind of visual where we have a terminal, so a text only interface, and we are entering in commands into a program. So I mean, this is MS DOS. So they probably have some name for their shell, I don't know what their shells call, probably MS DOS as well. And so that is an example of that. So again, I want to point out that people often use the terms terminal shell console in different ways, and erroneously, but usually it's just to describe interacting with a shell. So what is the AWS command line interface? Well, it allows users to programmatically interact with the AWS API via entering single or multi line commands into a shell, or a terminal. So here is an example of a command that's being entered into the to cli. And if you look here closely, this part here, the part where it says it was that is the command line interface. Okay, that's the CLI. And then it's followed up with commands, and then sub commands. And then it has parameters. And it's all text, right. So the idea is that we input that, and we get an output. The end of the CLI is a Python executable program. CLIs can be written in whatever language that people want to write them in. But when they're packaged to you, you might not realize that there's an underlying language, it is good to know what the underlying language of the CLI is so that you have all the requirements to run it. So Python is required, it has to be on your system to install the CLI, the CLI can be installed on Windows, Mac, or Linux, or Unix. The name of the CLI of the program is called a bus. So there you go.
