 at the anatomy of an alarm. So here is the diagram for the alarm. And this is going to make sense here in a moment. So the threshold condition, it defines when a data point is breached, okay, so what you're doing is you're defining this line, and whatever's above it is breached or below it, those rules can change based on some conditions, you have your metric, this is the actual data we are measuring. And a metric could be something such as network in, okay, so that's that you have your data point, this represents the metrics measurement at a given period, then you have the period, this is how often it checks to evaluate the alarm, which apparently is not true, it doesn't mean the data becomes available, it's actually always five minutes, I believe. But anyway, that's the period of data points that will be collected, then you have the evaluation period. So this is the number of previous periods. And then you have data points to alarm. So this is for one data point is breached, an evaluation period is going to go back for rules. So this is what actually triggers the alarm that when you want to play, pay close attention to there. So there you go. Alright, so let's take a look at the type of conditions we
