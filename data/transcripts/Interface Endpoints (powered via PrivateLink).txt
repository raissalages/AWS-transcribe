 interface endpoints are EN eyes with a private IP address, and they serve as an entry point for traffic going to a supported service. This is all via private link, I didn't write private link here, but it is a thing of private link. And so here's an example of a diagram that is utilizing private link, we have the interface endpoint over here, you can see that there's an ENI. And it's going out to very specific data services that it supports. So you access services hosted on the bus easily and securely by keeping your network traffic within the AWS network. Remember, the whole point of these endpoints is to keep traffic internally within AWS. And interface endpoint supports the following database services. So there's quite a few there might even be more now. But the point is, it supports a broad range of services. I don't think it's super important to remember exactly which ones but API gateway always seems to be on the top of that list there. The thing is interface endpoints are not free, as long as they are provision, they are costing you money. And I mean, I think these costs are up to date. But the point is, is that for each endpoint you are deploying, you are looking at least $7 a month. And the thing is, is it's per endpoint per AZ. So this cost can stack up very quickly, if you are, if you have a, if you have to connect to multiple availability zones. So you know, I try to avoid using interface endpoints as much as I can. And this is more of like an enterprise product. So just understand that there is that cost there. Okay.
