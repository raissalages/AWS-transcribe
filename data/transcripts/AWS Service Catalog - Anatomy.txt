 Alright, so let's take a quick look at the anatomy of the service catalog. And so I have a one side for the administrative user who manages the catalog, and then the end user who uses the catalog. And we have these nice architectural diagrams describing all the components, and we'll just walk through them quickly here. So on the administrative user, you create portfolios and portfolios are just containers for products, permissions and constraints. And then we're going to look at those three now. So you have the product itself. And this basically is just a cloud formation template, which could have associated service actions. We'll talk about those in a moment. Then you have your permissions about who can view and launch products. And this is you assigning groups, roles and users that are approved to the portfolio, which grants you access for those products, then you have constraints. And these apply rules on provision products. There's five different kinds of rules and just kind of limits on how these products can be used. Then on the end user side, you have the catalog, it's a user friendly console to view and launch products, then you have the products themselves, and they're just visible in the catalog to launch. When a product is launched, it's considered a provision product. And again, these are just cloud formation stacks. So that's all it is underneath. And then there's these things called service action service actions allow you to give end users some additional controls around these launch resources. And they are just really SSM documents that to perform tasks on the stack. So there you go.
