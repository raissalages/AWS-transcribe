 this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro. And we are looking at step functions which allow you to coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows. Or another way of thinking about it is creating a state machine with micro services. So here we are taking a look at step functions. And the first thing we need to know before understanding it is understanding what a state machine is. So a state machine is an abstract model, which decides how one state moves to another based on a series of conditions. So think of a state machine like a flowchart, because that's exactly what it is, and what it looks like. And so coming to talking about what is step function, so step function coordinates multiple AWS services into a serverless workflow. It's a graphical console to visualize the components of your applications, a series of steps, it automatically triggers and tracks each step, retries them when there are errors. So your application executes in the order is expected every time, and logs the state of each step. So when things go wrong, you can diagnose and debug problems quickly. And so here's an example from step functions, where we have this visual workflow here. And you can see there's a bunch of different steps. And it might not be clear what AWS services underlying AWS services are being used in those steps. But you can code in pretty much a handful of services there, which we'll dig into more right now. Alright, before we move on to use cases with step functions, let's talk about the two types of statements genes we get to choose from. So when you make a step function, you have to choose a state machine. And we have standard and express standard is for general purpose stuff and expresses for streaming data kind of stuff. So looking at standard here, AWS recommends it for durable checkpointed workflows for machine learning, order fulfillment, it DevOps automation, ETL jobs and other long duration works load. So long workloads, and then looking at Express and Express just came out. And this is for event driven workflows for streaming data processing, microservice orchestrations, IoT data ingestion, mobile backends, and short duration, high event rate workloads. And when we get into the fall long, we'll look at these in better comparison, because there is a huge difference between these two here, they have a nice big chart there when we're creating our step functions. So another thing I want to point out is that you can execute steps in parallel. So if you have a bunch of steps that are dependent on each other before you want it to move to the next step, that is something you can do. So things don't just have to be sequential. And the last thing is that the way you define your your steps or your states is through this Amazon states language, which is written in JSON. So you do that visual editor, but you have to go and do this part. And this part is a bit of a pain. But the the step functions console does give you a bunch of templates to start off with. So it does ease that pain a bit, but there is that work involved. So now we can move on to use cases. So now we're going to take a look at some use cases for step functions and
