 Hey, everybody, it's Andrew Brown. And we are taking a look at manage versus custom versus inline policies. I almost forgot to put this in the course. And I'm here packaging, or the courses last minute. So I didn't have time to update the slides. But we can make it very clear the difference of these three types of policies. So when you have a policy, or sorry, a role, you need to attach policies to it. And there are three kinds. The first is a managed policy. These are ones that AWS provides to you. And you'll notice, you'll be able to notice which ones they are, because they have the little orange box in the UI, I think the UI might have a newer update to it. So it'll look very similar to that. But there's an example of a managed service. I think most of them, if not all of them, say Amazon in front of them, then there are custom manager policies. These are ones that you create and that you can attach to your roles. So hopefully that is clear. And then we have inline policies. So these are ones that you're adding in a jiffy. So they're not policies that are ones that you can utilize for multiple roles, or they're just directly attached to a role. So there you go.
