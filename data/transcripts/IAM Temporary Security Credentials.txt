 So temporary security credentials are just like programmatic access keys, except they are temporary. And they're used in the following scenarios when we were dealing with identity federation, delegation, cross account access, and I am roles. And so we're going to look in more detail at identity federation and cross account access in the upcoming slides. But let's talk about how they are different from programmatic access keys. The first thing is that they lack four minutes to an hour. So they're very short term credentials. And they're not stored with the user, but they're generated dynamically and provided the user when requested. So with programmatic access keys, they're strongly linked to a specific user. But in this case, we just give them these credentials when they need them. And these temporary credentials are the basis for roles and identity Federation. So you've actually been using temporary security credentials this entire time, but you probably just don't know it. So anytime you use a role, and I am role, they actually generate out an STS, which is the token that is used for temporary credentials. But you just don't notice it because it does it for you. But let's dig deep more into this stuff here.
