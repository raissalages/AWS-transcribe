 All right, let's take a look here at the schema conversion tool. This is a standalone desktop app that will convert your database schema to another database engine. So here is a diagram or sorry, a graphic of it in Windows. And this thing only runs on Windows, Linux, Fedora, Ubuntu, and it does not run on Mac. I've never used this because I primarily use the Mac, even though I record on a Windows machine here. But I might open it up here just to take a peek here and see what we can take a look at. But I'm not that excited to use it. And it's not like a huge, important thing to know on exams, I think for the social marketing professional, maybe the data engineer one, they want you to know a bit about this tool. But I can't imagine you have to know it in great detail. So I'll download and open it up, but we're not going to do much with it. Okay.
