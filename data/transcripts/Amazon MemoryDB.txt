 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And we're taking a look here at Amazon memory DB, which is a Redis compatible in memory database for ultra fast performance. There's a lot of little talking points we could do about this, but I know that we just need to know how to utilize memory DB. So I want to keep this slide super simple, and make it very clear the difference between this service and ElastiCache. So memory DB has additional persistent guarantees over ElastiCache making memory DB suitable as a primary database. And when I did the lab, I didn't even realize that I was just thinking maybe there was extra managed things that there are. But really, it's because it has those guarantees. And the and the other thing is that memory DB writes are in the milliseconds, whereas ElastiCache writes are in the microseconds. So ElastiCache is a lot faster at writes. But this trade off is going to give you that persistence. So hopefully, that is clear enough as the difference between when you would use memory DB DB over over using ElastiCache. Some might compare memory DB as the Aurora of ElastiCache, if you will, but to me, the distinguishing feature is that this one can be used as a primary database. So there you go.
