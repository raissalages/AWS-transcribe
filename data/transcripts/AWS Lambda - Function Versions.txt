 working with AWS lambda, you can use versions to manage the deployment of your AWS lambda functions. The idea here is you publish a new version of the lambda for beta testing, without affecting the production version, many use cases for it. The idea is you'll publish a new version, give it a description. And notice that the version is numbered, but you can see the description down below. Each version will have its own unique ARN. So hopefully that is clear there. When you reference a lambda, you can reference it two ways, we have the qualified ARN and the unqualified ARN. The key difference is that the qualified ARN specifically specifies the version suffix, so you're getting that exact version. If you do not specify the version, so you're doing unqualified ARN, you cannot utilize aliases, unqualified ARNs always point to latest. So the two up there is the same thing. Okay.
