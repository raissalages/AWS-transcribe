 So let's take a look at access keys, because this is one of the ways you can interact with AWS pragmatically either through the AWS CLI or the SDK. So when you create a user, and you say it's allowed to have programmatic access, it's going to then create an access key for you, which is an ID and a secret access key. One thing to note is that users can only have up to two access keys within their account. So down below, you can see that we have one, as soon as we add a second one, that gray button for create access key will vanish. And if we want more, we would either have to we'd have to remove keys, okay. But you know, just be aware that that's what access keys are. And you can make them inactive and you're only allowed to have two.
