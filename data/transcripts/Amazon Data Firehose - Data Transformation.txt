 we're talking about data transformation. So this is pretty much for everything, you can do this for anything, any kind of destination you choose can have this. But the idea is that before you send your data to your destination, you can run it against a lambda, it can do any kind of transformation you want. So that's very useful. When enable firehose will buffer incoming data, you can change the buffer size from 0.2 to three megabytes, you can change the buffer size from zero to 900 seconds. So I believe basically, when you buffer it, basically how much data it will, it will receive at one given time. So that's something that's important there. There is a payload size limit of six megabytes for both the lambda requests and response. So just understand that there is that limit. When designing these lambdas, you can do data transformation. So you can and sorry, when you sorry, we're still talking about data transformation. But when you do data transformation, the JSON payload from the lambda has to return this specific information has to return the record ID, which firehose will give you and you just pass it along, you have to give it a result. So it's either okay, dropped or processing failed. And then you actually have to pass the transfer data long, but you have to make sure that the base 64 encoded. And so it has a blueprint in both Python and JavaScript. It's very easy to write, you can convert it to any language you want. But you can see here, the idea is that we have the record ID coming in as the event data from firehose, then you have your data and notice that they are decoding the base 64 content. And then you do whatever you want to that data, and then you have to re encode it. And then we tell the result is okay. And then we return that JSON object. Okay, so pretty straightforward.
