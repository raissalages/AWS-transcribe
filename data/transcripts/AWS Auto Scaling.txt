 NMS Auto Scaling is a service that can discover scaling resources within your AWS account and quickly add scaling plans to your scaling resources. You can have a central inventory of all your scaling resources. And it can manage and make recommendations for the following scaling resources, EC2 auto scaling groups, ECS specifically for EC2, which underneath uses auto scaling groups, Amazon Aurora, Amazon DynamoDB, and spot fleet. It allows you to easily apply dynamic scaling, which is just target tracking underneath predictive scaling. So if you don't know, dynamic scaling is when a metric changes, and so does the capacity. And predictive scaling analyzes historical load generates a forecast and scales based on that forecast. You can make these using EC2 auto scaler, or auto scaling, it's not hard to make dynamic or predictive scaling. But the thing is, is that this is just a tool that makes it easier if you're not good at using the CLI. Or if you just want a more simplified approach for creating scaling, you can create your auto scaler and then go over here and then make all your scaling operations here. So yeah, it's just a convenience tool, we do a lab on this to have an idea of how it works. But yeah, there you go.
