 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And we are taking a look at the AWS snow family. So these are storage and compute devices used to physically move data in or out of the cloud when moving data over the internet or private connections. When the connection is too slow, difficult or costly. Let's take a look first at snow cone. So there it is, then we have snow edge, and then we have snowmobile. So those are our three sizes. There used to be one called just snowball, but they retired that and so now we just have snowball edge. And we'll talk about each of these individually in their specs. But let's just take a quick look at you know, the shape they come in. So so come comes in two sizes, we have an eight terabyte of storage, which has hard disk drives. And then we have a 14 terabyte of storage with solid state drives, then you have snowball edge generally comes into types. We have the storage optimize and the compute optimized, then you have snowmobile, which is for transporting 100 petabytes of storage, as the picture implies, it's that big cargo container, the back, there's basically a data center of storage in there, and you load up your data, and they drive it to AWS. This data is delivered to Amazon s3. So there you go, we'll get into each of these services now. Okay.
