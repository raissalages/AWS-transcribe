 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And we are taking a look at database migration service, also known as DMS, which allows you to quickly and securely migrate one database to another DMS can be used to migrate your on premise database database. So here's a diagram where you have your source database that goes to source endpoint, which will go to a replication task or migration task, which has the computer around it for replication instance, to the target endpoint to the target database. There are different flavors of DMS. So there's a serverless version where you don't have the replication instance, it's just, well, there's compute, but you just don't see it. And there's a third kind, we'll talk about that in the next slide. There's something that I really wanted to point out that I was confused about, I did not realize these were two separate things. But there's the in a schema conversion. And then there's the in a schema conversion tool. So the first one is something that happens automatically. And basically, when you map one database to another, it has this very simple rules that you can utilize to do that. Whereas the in a schema conversion tool is a downloadable desktop app for more complex use cases, when you're, let's say, migrating data from a data warehouse, there's a lot of possible sources here, I'm just going to quickly click through them, I'm not going to say them out loud here, as you can see them, we have a lot of possible targets. So you can see there's a lot of variety here. But based on how you do your migration, there might be some limitations in terms of what you can utilize. But you can see there's a lot of stuff here. Each migration path requires a bit of research, it's not all combinations of sources and targets are possible. So everything requires some investigation. Let's talk about the migration methods, as there are three that are possible, we have homogenous data migration, which they don't show that in the console as such. It's called I think migration tasks or something else. But the idea here is that you migrate data with native database tools. So using pg dump or pg restore, whatever those migration tools utilize, I would imagine this is probably limited to very specific relational databases like MySQL, Postgres, MariaDB, you create a migration project, that's what it's called migration project in DMS. And it will perform the migration using a serverless compute uses a pay as you go model, then you have instance replication, this is the original one, this is the one that I will do in the lab, because it's just super reliable, super fast. But this is where you provision instance with a chosen instance type to perform the replication between databases, then you have a service one called service replication, also known as DMS serverless. And yeah, I guess it's serverless and homogenous data migration is serverless. But basically, service replication is the service version of instance replication where you have a service offering as you pay as you go, it does not have public IPs, you must use a VPC endpoint to access specific services as limited selection of possible source and targets. It doesn't support views and selections and transformation rules. So it is more limited. But the idea is that it's supposed to be easier to use an instance replication. But honestly, I found this replication easier to use still. And the larger the type, the faster your instance replication will go. So when you do this, utilize the service even for the small databases, do not choose a small size, or you'll be waiting forever. It's not worth it. Okay, or just watch the video and see how I do it. Because this one can really be a time sick, I just want to save you some time. Okay. There are more functionality to DMS, they have additional things on there. If I feel like covering them, I'll cover them in separate slides. But for the exams, they don't really get that deep into DMS, depending on which exam you're taking. Okay, so there you go.
