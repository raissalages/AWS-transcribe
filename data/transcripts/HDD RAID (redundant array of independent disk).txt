 Alright, so when we're talking about hard disk drives, we need to also understand RAID, which is the redundant array of independent disks. It is a data storage virtual technology for magnetic disks, not magnetic tapes, but disks, to improve fault tolerance. RAID combines multiple physical volumes into a logical group, storing redundant data across disks. Since hard drives have mechanical parts and will result in wear, hard drives are more prone to failure than solid state drives. If you have very important data, you're definitely going to want to have RAID configuration. And so RAID has like a number, like RAID 0, RAID 1, whatever, and this is going to determine how it operates. So RAID 0, which is called striping, has no redundancy, no redundancy, the data is split across disks for high performance. So increases the speed and capacity, but offers no fault tolerance. So it's just like when you want to treat multiple disks with one disk, minimum of two disks required. We have RAID 1 called mirroring. This is where data is duplicated on two or more disks offering high redundancy. If one disk fails, the data is still accessible from another requires at least two disks. So this is where we're copying or mirroring stuff to another place. Striping with parity, parity, which is RAID 5, combines striping and parity for both speeds and data protection can withstand the failure of one drive without the data loss requires at least three disks. Then we have RAID 6, striping with double parity. So similar to RAID 5, but with double parity, allowing it to survive the failure of two disks requires at least four disks. Then we have RAID 10, which is actually one plus O. Where is two, three, and four? I don't know. Don't ask me. I have no idea. But these are the most common ones you should know. A combination of RAID 1 and RAID 0 offering redundancy and increased performance requires a minimum of four disks. It's good to know RAID 0 and RAID 1 as those are the most common that you'll come across. But there you go.
