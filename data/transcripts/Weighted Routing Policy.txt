 weighted routing policies let you split up traffic based on different weights assigned. This allows you to send a certain percentage of overall traffic to one server and have other traffic to be directed to a completely different server. So for example, if you had an ALB running experimental features, you could test against a small amount of traffic at a at random to minimize the impact of the effect. So coming back over to here with our pen tool knows it says here weighted routing policy, weighted records, and then we're providing the weights here. So hopefully that is clear. There you go.
