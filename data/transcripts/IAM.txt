 Hey, this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro. And we are taking a look at AWS identity and access management, also known as I am. And you can use this service to create and manage it as users groups use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. So there's a quite a few components here, let's get to it. So the first is I am policies. So these are JSON documents, which grant permissions for specific users, groups or a role to access services, and policies are attached to I am identities, then you have I am permissions or permission. And this is an API action that can or cannot be performed. And they're represented in the I am policy document, then there's the I am identities. So we have I am users, these are end users who log into the console or interact with AWS resources pragmatically, or via clicking UI interfaces, you have I am groups. So these these group up your users, so they all share the same permission levels. So that maybe it's admins, developers or auditors, then you have I am roles. So these roles grant AWS resources, permissions to specific AWS API actions, and associate policies to a role and then assign it to an AWS resource. So just understand that roles are when you're attaching these two resources. So like if you have an EC two instance, and you say it has to access s3, you're going to be attaching a role, not a policy directly, okay.
