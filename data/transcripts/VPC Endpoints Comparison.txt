 Let us compare VPC endpoints to make sure that we clearly understand the difference between these three as they are a little bit confusing. And so we'll look across these feature categories. And hopefully we'll solidify the difference here. So the first we'll talk about type. So interface endpoints are reliant on elastic network interfaces, our ENIs, gateway endpoints are gateways, a gateway with a VPC. And then gateway load balancer is a type of interface endpoint. So it is a a subset of the interface endpoint over here. What is the use case for interface endpoints? Well, they provide private connections to AWS services, partnered services and other VPCs without public IPs. For gateway endpoints, their private connections to either s3 or DynamoDB from the VPC. And at this point, there is no other services that gateway endpoints work with the gateway load balancer endpoint will route traffic to third party virtual appliances, like firewalls in another VPC for service integration. This is utilizing AWS private link for gateway endpoints. It is utilizing s3 and DynamoDB for gateway load balancer endpoints is utilizing it as private link as well as the gateway load balancer to perform this endpoint connection for supported services. It supports a lot of stuff as we had shown in the prior list when we covered interface endpoints, gateway endpoint again, s3 DynamoDB for gateway load balancer endpoints, it is for third party virtual appliances. So it's going to vary based on the appliance. If that makes sense. For pricing, this is going to be per hour when provision and data process of interface endpoints, you really have to think about it and factor in your costs because this can add up very quickly if you are running multi AZs and and and have a lot of stuff going on here for gateway endpoints. They're free for gateway load balancer endpoint, understand what it's using under the hood, it's using AWS private links. So it's going to be subject to very similar pricing. For routing mechanism, it's using DNS, DNS interception routing. For gateway endpoints, it routes table entries for specific destinations. For gateway load balancer, it's using gateway load balancer to do the routing for traffic direction. It's bi directional for interface endpoints for gateway endpoint, it's uni directional, and gateway load balancer for the most part is usually uni directional. But there can be some variation there. Again, remember what is the underlying stuff for gateway load balancer endpoint because it is just a subset of interface endpoints. But there you go.
