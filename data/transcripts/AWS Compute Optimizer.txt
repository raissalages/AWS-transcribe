 Andrew Brown, we are taking a look at AWS compute optimizer. This analyzes the current configuration of your AWS compute resources and their utilization metrics from Amazon CloudWatch over a period of last 14 days, it could make recommendations for EC two instances, auto scaling groups, EBS volumes, lambda functions, ECS services on Fargate or SQL Server licenses, there is supposed to be another bullet point there. I'm not sure what happened there. But sometimes these slides get away from me. But yeah, we'll just pretend that there is a bullet point there. Excellent. It will recommend specific configuration changes to save money. So here's an example of an EBS volume that it's saying, hey, this is the recommended size that you should utilize, you get some charts for this thing. I was hoping a lot more from this service. Because I had an account that had a lot of stuff running in it, it didn't really make that many suggestions other than you can see here lambda functions. But we'll explore it's very straightforward service. Yeah, and there you go. Transcribed by https://otter.ai
