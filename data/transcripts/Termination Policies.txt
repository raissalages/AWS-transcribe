 termination policies decide the order of terminating instances. And so here is an example of a termination policy. And notice there that we see oldest launch configurations closest to next instance hour. So there are predefined policies here, we have default, we have allocation strategy, oldest launch template, oldest launch configuration, closest to next instance, our next instance, oldest instance, and so we have a bunch there, if you want to know about them in more detail, read the documentation, because I got big blocks of text on that, I didn't feel like it was worth our time to summarize, because it's pretty straightforward, what most of these do, you can create a custom termination policy by invoking a lambda function. So that is also an option if you need something outside the predefined policies. But there you go.
