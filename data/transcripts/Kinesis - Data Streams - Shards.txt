 Let's talk about shards. And this is all for provision provisioning. Obviously, this is not important for the on demand stuff. But for shards, it can use this data stream is a set of shards. Each shard can support up to five transactions per second per reads up to a maximum total data read rate of two megabytes per second, up to 1000 records per second for rights, up to a maximum total data of right, right rate of one megabyte per second, including the partition key. Each shard has a sequence of data records. Each data record has a sequence number that is assigned by the kinesis data stream. If your data rate increases, you can increase or decrease the number of shards allocated to your stream, then you have your partition keys, you actually have to set a partition key when you write data. So used to group data by shard within a stream, partition keys are unicorns, Unicode strings with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. So basically, you can call it whatever you want, you call it Apple, you call it dog, whatever you want to call your partition key, the MD five hash function is used to map partition keys to 128 bit integer values and to map the associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the shards. When an application puts data into the stream, it must specify a partition key. So in practice, what I noticed is that you have a partition key, you don't say what shard it goes to, but it goes somewhere on to some of the shards. But you if you only have one shard, you don't need to have multiple partition keys, you just name everything the same. Okay, so you'll see me in the lab, probably I'll be naming different partition keys and with one shard. It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't doesn't matter. The other thing that well, we'll talk about this in a second, but we'll talk about sequence numbers. So each data record has a sequence number that is unique per partition key within its shard sequence numbers for the same partition key generally increase over time, the longer the time the period, the longer the time period between right request the largest sequence number becomes. So there's those your components. When I'm doing this in the lab, you'll see there's a bit of confusion for me because they'll show you like the sequence numbers and shards and the docs don't really spell us out too much. So just understand that I'm a bit confused in the labs and you'll feel a bit confused. But I think that once you start working with kinesis more, it starts to make sense a bit more.
