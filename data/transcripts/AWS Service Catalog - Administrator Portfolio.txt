 look at portfolios in service catalog here on the administrator side. So here is a portfolio and it has a collection of products and you can set constraints on how those products are used. And you can also associate different types of identity such as groups, roles or users that's going to determine who's able to see the actual products and launch them. Okay, so what I do want to emphasize, though, is that all products in the portfolio will be shared to the added identities. And you cannot limit some products to some users in a portfolio. So you can't just say, and those constraints don't help either. It's not like you can say, okay, only these two products for these two people. And these two products for those two people, you just have to make separate portfolios in those use cases. But I just want quickly want to show you can add a group, you can add a role, or you can add a user and that's going to that's going to determine who has access.
