 Hey, this is Andrew Brown, we're taking a look at solid state drives. So this is an example of a solid state drive where the interior is open. So solid state drives use integrated circuits, ICs, assemblies as memory to store data persistently, typically using flash memory, SSDs are more resistant to physical shock, run silently and have quicker access time and low latency. An example of where that data is stored here is it's using NAND flash memory. So NAND is like a logical operator. That's why there's NAND. I think there's like NOR as well for that kind of stuff. They're very good for frequent reads and writes, no physical moving parts, as you can see, there's no platters, there's no actuators inside of those. There's a variety of types of SSD and it really depends on the connection type. So we have SATA SSDs widely used, compatible with most computers offering good performance, but slower and slower than MBM ease due to SATA interface limitations. We didn't talk about SATA or interfaces with the hard disk drives. But there are SATA hard disk drives, of course, and older formats. I forgot the older one is ID or something. I can't remember. It's been too long. We have NVMe is the reason I want to cover this was just to talk about MBM ease really, but MBM ease use the PCI interface for higher performance ideal for intensive data tasks gaming available in the M.2 or the PCEI card factors. We have M.2, so this is suitable for laptops, compact PCs, use the SATA or MBMe interfaces they install directly on the motherboard. We have U.2 SSDs similar to the performance of the N.2 NVMe SSDs, but designed for 2.5 inch drive bays mainly used in enterprise servers environments. Additional SSDs, external drives for easy portability. Then we have PCI SSDs. These are add on cards that provide high performance older systems. You can see the word MBMe a lot in cloud service providers. So I figured getting a little bit of knowledge about where the stuff's coming from might help cement that knowledge later on. Let's talk about SATA. So the SATA, which stands for Serial Advanced Technology Attachments, these are the most common and are compatible with serial ATA interfaces. Okay, used by most desktop, laptop computers, they're relatively easy to install and offer good performance, though they are typically slower than MBM ease counterparts due to their limitations of same interfaces. So somebody's not using MBM ease probably using SATA. This is what the SATA port looks like. This is a SATA cable. As you can see, it goes from big to small. Here is a SATA SSD where it has a data and power source. As you can see there, we have PCI SSD. These are add on cards that fit into the PCI slots on the motherboard. They can offer high very high performance, especially in configurations that support MBMe. They're a good option for users looking to upgrade older systems or specialized high performance tasks. The PCI slot on the motherboard comes in different sizes referred to as lanes. Obviously, the bigger the lane, the better the performance. But there's also generations besides just the sizes we're going to be looking at per lane in 16 slots. But as we went through time, and notice 2003, 2005, every year, it's basically doubling, it doubled. You can see here on the right hand side. So you can see the bandwidth has increased again and again and again and again and again, the latest being 2022 for PCIe 6.0. We have non-volatile memory expresses what we really wanted to talk about. So MBMe SSDs use the PCIe interface. That's why we're talking about the interface offering significantly higher performance compared to SATA SSD, which is why we talked about SATA SSDs. You knew what it was. They are designed to take full advantage of high speed, high speeds of flash based storage technologies. MBMe drives are found in the form of M.2. It can also be added to a computer using a PCI expanded slot. So we have M.2 SSDs. Again, these are MBMe or these are just form factors basically. Compact suitable for laptops and compact PCs can use SATA or MBMe interfaces. They're installed directly on the motherboard. They look like this. Then you have U.2 SSDs similar to performance to MBMe, but designed for 2.5 drive bays, mainly used in enterprise and server environments. They generally connect to the U.2 port. They can connect to other types of ports, but they have their own port. I just want to show it to you because you've probably never seen it. If you haven't worked with inner data centers or other places, you may have never seen a U.2 SSD. But you saw a graphic of the SATA one which looked like a normal drive. Then you have the M.2, which looks like a stick. And you got this U.2, which is a bit more of a square. So there you go. Okay.
