 So a large reel of magnetic tape, a tape drive is used to write data to tape, medium and large sized data centers deploy both tape and disk formats. They normally come in the form of a cassette. Magnetic is very cheap to produce and can store considerable amounts of data. If you remember like supercomputers from the 60s or 70s, they are using magnetic tape, durable for decades, a good for at least 30 years cheap to produce. They use a tape drive to read the modern consets. This is an example of a modern cassette where the tape is on the interior. We did cover more magnetic stuff in another section, so you'll get the knowledge across both of those. But there you go. Okay.
