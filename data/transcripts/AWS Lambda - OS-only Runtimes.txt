 os only runtimes for lambda is when there is not a pre installed programming language, or language specific libraries, when you want to compile your language or programs to be used. There are three use cases for os only runtimes, native ahead of time compilation, third party runtimes and custom runtimes. Let's talk about the first one languages such as go rust, c++ dotnet native AOT, which I don't know what AOT means, but it's in there. Java, gravel, VM native, I hate these names, I don't know who comes up with these things, compiled natively to an executable binary, which doesn't require a dedicated language runtime, there's just no need for it, right? If they're going to compile the binaries, you just copy the binaries over, you must still include a runtime interface client in your binary, you must compile your binary for a Linux environment for the same instruction set architecture, then you have third party runtimes, like runtimes for PHP, there's an open source community called breath, or project called breath allows you to run PHP, just like any other runtimes. It's super awesome. Then we have one for Swift, this is Swift AWS lambda runtime, why would anybody want to use Swift, I have no idea why, but you absolutely could, because of the community. Or let's say you needed to build a custom runtime that's not supported. So like you are using a very old version of Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and you you want to have runtime, so you build your own. So those are some examples there. The the the the the OS is for these runtimes is going to be Amazon Linux two, and Amazon Linux 2023. So those are two options. So there you go.
