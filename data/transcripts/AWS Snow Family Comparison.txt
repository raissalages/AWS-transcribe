 Alright, let's go compare the snow family. So we have a general idea how these things stack up. The first is usable hard drive storage. So if you are using hard disk drive based on your variants for snow cone, you have a terabytes for snowball edge, you can have up to 80 terabytes. For SSD, snow cone 14 terabytes. And then for snowball edge, you can see that the the first one there has one terabyte, but then you have one with 210 terabytes with NVMe. And then for the compute, you have 28 terabytes snowmobile does not have SSD storage. It's weird, it does not specify it just as na for hard drive storage. So I'm not exactly sure what's going on there. But we don't need to know that much about snowmobile anyway, for usable CP, v CPUs. So crone has two snowball edge has 40. And then the other other versions of snowball edge have 104 v CPUs. I don't know why, but I thought snowmobile did compute, but I guess it doesn't. So it's just a big data storage thing that's moving. You think that'd be really useful because if it was like connected and had a signal it could then track like crunch data as it's being delivered, I kind of swore that it could do it. Anyway, the device sizes here vary. Not much not that important to remember that device weight. So snow count is 2.1 kilograms of 4.5 pounds, snowball edges about 50 pounds. And obviously, we don't care how heavy the snowmobile is. For storage clustering, the compute version of snowball edge can have between three to 16 nodes, we have 256 bit encryption across the board, that book compliant for snowball edging snow snowmobile if you are trying to get it. And there you go. Okay.
