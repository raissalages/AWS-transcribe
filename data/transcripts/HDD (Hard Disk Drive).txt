 All right, let's just make sure we are familiar with hard disk drive. So there's an example of one you if you're old enough, you probably remember these things. Hard disk drive is a magnetic storage that uses rotating platters, an actuator arm and a magnetic head, similar to a record player. They're very good at writing a continuous amounts of data. They're not great for writing small reads and writes. So think of the arm of the record playing a player having to lift up and down and move around. They're better for throughput there, they have physical moving parts, so they have more wear and tear. So you know, they're more likely to have issues in terms of reliability. There's this idea of RPMs because there is a thing that's spinning physically. So we should note these are this is revolutions per minute, the speed at which the drive platter spin, the platter is like the record, faster RPMs mean faster access time slower RPMs mean better cost savings. And there's actually specific RPMs that we might care about, versus 72,000 RPMs. These are standard for desktop high performance external drives offering a good balance of performance cost, power consumption, we have 54,000 RPMs used in laptops, external drives, apps where lower power consumption and heat are priorities over top performance. And then we have 10,000. So I like I should have put like 54 above and then 72 I don't know I did in that order, but mostly found in enterprise environments or high end workstations where performance is critical, though, these are less common today due to the rise of solid state drives. So yeah, there we go.
