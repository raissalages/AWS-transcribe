 Okay. AWS has multiple competing projects to provide auto completion while typing out a bus CLI commands. The first is a bus completer. This was the original autocomplete afraid of us probably intended for CLI version one don't use it. Its legacy is super limited. It was great back in the day, but it is served its time. Let's move on. Then came about a shell. And this looked really cool. It was an interactive shell with the AWS CLI. But this project hasn't been active since 2020. And it looks like its functionality has been rolled directly into the data with CLI. There are bugs that are going back to years that they're just never going to solve. So I do not recommend to use this tool despite it being listed as a, a thing in the AWS CLI marketing page. Maybe they've fixed it. But when I went there, they were heavily promoting this, even though it's clearly old, and not recommended for use. And the one you should use is called the AWS CLI auto prompt. So this uses CLI version two. And it gives you very similar functionality functionality to the able shell. And this is the way that I'm recommending that you use auto prompt. And we're going to focus on all the functionality of it because it's such a useful tool in the next upcoming slides. Okay. It was CLI auto prompt is a powerful interactive shell built into the AWS CLI to assist in writing CLI commands. This tool is so awesome, it's going to make your life so much easier. And you don't have to be a super expert at writing CLI commands, because it's going to show you a lot of the information in place. This thing can do fuzzy search command completion, parameter completion, resource completion, shorthand completion, file completion, region completion, profile completion, documentation panel, projected output panel, command history, two different modes of activation, and works anywhere the other CLIs install, it's super useful, you should absolutely make use of this as much as you can. When I'm using a local developer environment where I have my terminal on my Mac or Linux machine, I can use it to its full potential. When you're in a cloud developer environment, or the cloud shell, those panels that give you useful information don't work well. And it's not the fault of the tool, it's the fault of the browser's environment. So just understand that you might not see me using those output panels in the documentation panels, often in video tutorials. But locally, when I'm when I'm confusing the tools that I want to use, I can make use of that stuff very effectively. So for the documentation panel, the idea is that if you want to see a command or sub command documentation, and you have that panel open, it's going to show you the information. Okay, so here's a command, there's a sub command, if you want to bring it up, it's f3. And as you type, it's going to, then start showing you that information contextually change, you can navigate between panels by pressing F2. So you can actually go down into the documentation panel and then start scrolling up and down by using the VI directions, that's vim, key commands, J for down K for up. So you can basically navigate all the documentation without leaving the console, which is nice. So for configuration, there are multiple ways to enable auto prompt, you can put a flag so that it'll only execute for that single command. Auto prompt is not turned on by default, so you have to always provide some kind of flag. If you don't want to do that every single time you enter in a database command, you can export an environment variable to the your current shell, just understand that it's only going to be for the current, the current shell, if you open up another tab, it's not going to necessarily work. So you'd have to set that end bar in your bash profile. So it'll persist in all future profiles, or runtime environments that are open in your terminal. You can also set this in your configuration file, I always use the environment variable, that's just the way that I do it. There's a couple different modes that you can utilize, there's full mode. So every time you, you execute an able to see like command, it's going to open up. Whereas in partial mode, it's only going to execute auto prompt, if you let's say mess up the command, or you don't completely fill it in. The reason why I want to use partial mode is that when we are writing bash scripts, it will still try to open up in full mode. And this is really annoying, because you don't want this to happen. So it's going to mess up our coding workflow. So set it to on partial, we have an output panel, this is going to show us the schema for a sub command. So let's say we're trying to create a table, we want to see what results we get back in terms of JSON, we can see that if we press f5, it's going to open up that panel so that we can start seeing that information. And I just want you to notice or notice that it's not real data, it's just skeleton data, because you'd have to send the command to get the data back. It does work with the query option. So as you are writing out your query, it'll actually even suggest you JP and then it'll filter out and show you exactly what you'll get back. It's a great way to quickly write query commands. It works with different output types. So you could use it with tables. Again, I would show this in my video tutorials, but I can't because I'm using cloud developer environment and this window doesn't open very well in Gitpod and things like that. For command history, you can press Ctrl R, this is a normal thing that you can do in your terminal to go back to previous commands. But when you're in the auto prompt, you can do that, and it'll give you your previous commands. So this will show commands that were successful or unsuccessful, so you can run them again, they will see like commands that that you do not enter, activate the auto prompt mode will not show up in the history. So if auto prompt was not activated, it's not going to be in that history. However, outside of auto prompt, if you do enter commands in that did that were never entered in auto prompt, you can search for them using Ctrl R and do a fuzzy search. This is not a functionality of it was alive. This is just basic Linux batch terminal commands command history. But just understand that if you run a command in the command or in the auto prompt, it's not going to show outside, and vice versa. So that's just one limitation. But that'll make sense. As we start to work with the CLI, you'll see what I'm talking about. Sorry, long video, we have command completion. So notice it kind of auto completes the commands and sub commands, we have parameter completion, and it will even indicate to you which ones are required, and they'll show them first. Okay, so notice here, it says required, so you'll know exactly what to fill in that you have to fill in, we have resource completion. This is hit or miss. But the idea is that it will actually go to your account. So and it'll suggest names. So here I have DynamoDB describe table, and it's showing me table names. Same thing with VPC IDs. I have not found this to always work as, as expected, but it's cool when it does work. We have shorthand completion. So it will auto complete shorthand JSON syntax. So that is really useful when you are trying to provide a structure there. So notice here we are putting filters and saying name equals and showing you the shorthand that you should write. So that's really nice. For file completion, it will auto complete file names locally. So you can basically just tab your way through. It has region auto completion here. So the idea is you can provide the region and then it will show it here. It may not work until you type in other required parameters. So just understand that here we have make a bucket, we're providing the bucket, but it's not showing it here. And here's an example that it refuses to show because of the order that it's happening in. We have profile completion. So it will show you possible profiles you can enter in, it has fuzzy searching. So what that means is that you don't have to perfectly type it in, you could type in something like, notice we typed the word East, we didn't start with AP, and it still selected all the East here and the East here. So that's really nice. And notice here, I'm typing MCA, and it knows to do me, and then the C. So that is really nice. So there you go. That is AutoPrompt. Please use it. It is super awesome. Okay.
