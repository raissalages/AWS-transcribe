 managed file transfer workflows. So this is a fully managed serverless fire transfer workflow service to set up, run and automate monitor processing for files uploaded to the transfer family. Workflows allow you to perform the following following after files uploaded. So copy file tag file, delete file, custom file processing step, decrypt file, I'm just going to tell you right now that the transfer family is really, really, really hard to set up. In fact, we you we end up having to launch a simple ad. What do you call it directory, this actually might be one of the hardest labs that that I had to do. And I had to get bigos help to do it, just because we are going to have to touch Windows servers. So, you know, I didn't I kept the slides really light here, because we're gonna spend a lot of time in the labs. But basically, this service is for using FTP. So it's pretty straightforward. But we'll jump into the lab and you know, if you're not confident, just watch it because it is really hard. Okay.
