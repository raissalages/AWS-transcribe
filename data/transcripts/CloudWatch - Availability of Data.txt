 Alright, so with cloud watch, for different services, it will emit data to cloud watch and the availability of the data is going to vary based on the service, okay. And so just looking at example here with EC two and other services. So for EC two, if you spin up an EC two instance, it's going to, it's going to make the data available to you every five minutes. And if you put detailed monitoring on, it's going to be one minute, but for all the other services, it's going to be generally one minute, but sometimes it can be three or five. But I really want to point this out because it's really, really important on the exams that you understand that EC two is five minutes. And then with detailed monitoring, it's one and all their services are one by default. So it's just kind of one of those little weird gotchas. So I just really wanted to point that out to you.
