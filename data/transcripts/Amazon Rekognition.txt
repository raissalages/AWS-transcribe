 Hey, this is Andrew, and we are taking a look at Amazon recognition, which is an image and video recognition service, it analyzes images and videos to detect and detect and label objects, peoples and celebrities, I just want to tell you that I originally created these slides, and I did a really good job showing every single example. And then somehow, Baco, my co founder uploaded a blank version and write all my work away. So I used to have a lot more examples. And so I had to pare it down here, but it's still okay. Amazon recognition has the following pre built models, we have object detection, face detection, searching faces and connection, people pathing, detecting personal protective equipment, recognizing celebrities moderating content, detecting texts, detecting video segments, detecting face liveliness. For image requirements, it will accept JPEGs or PNGs. They have to be base 64 encoded. But if you're using specific SDKs, it will automatically do that for you. You can also access the stuff from an S3 bucket, which is a lot easier. Amazon recognition has this thing called custom labels, which is, if you don't want to use a pre pre built model, you want to build your own, build your own model, you can do that there. And then it can detect more unique things. Okay. We'll look at a couple examples. But there's a lot of endpoints that we can utilize pre built models, here is one for detect labels. So this is going to detect things in an image and then draw bounding box or tell you the coordinates of the bounding box that you could draw in a follow up one that we have face detection. So here it's showing us like the bounding box for a face, whether it has a mustache, eyes open confidence, there's a lot of options for this one. But again, there is a lot of things you can do with recognition. But if you could do a couple of these, and you can pretty much work with the rest there. So there you go. Okay.
