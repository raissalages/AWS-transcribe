 Let us take a look here at message timers. So this lets you specify an initial visibility period for an individual message when sending to the queue. So the idea here is that we are going to set the second delay on the send message. Okay, there's a little confusion here because it would seem like this is the same thing as delay queue, but it's not. And here, the key difference is that it's on individualized messages. Okay. So yes, it's the same, but ones at the whole queue level, and the other one is, is per message. Okay. So for message timers and delay queues, they're both called delay seconds, because they're both doing delays. Okay. Fevel queues don't support timers on individual messages. So that's the one exception. All right.
