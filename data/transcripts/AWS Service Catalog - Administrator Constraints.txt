 Now let's take a quick look at constraints for portfolios. So you can create constraints for specific products in your portfolio. And so this is what it looks like on the left hand side. But let's walk through all those constraint types. So the first type is launch and you what you can do here is you can specify an IAM role instead of the end user credentials that would be used and launching that resource. The reason you'd want to do this is so that you don't have to grant end user permissions to a service directly and this will be less permissive and more secure. Then you have notifications and these send product notifications to a stack. Then you have a template. This limits the options that are provided to the end user when launching a product. It also sets the restrictions on the underlying cloud formation parameter inputs. So you could just say only allow launching a t2 micro that one's extremely useful. Then you have stack set. This allows you to configure product deployments across accounts regions using AWS CloudFormation stack sets. I actually don't really understand this one but it's not a big deal. It's not gonna show up the test but I just wanted to point that one out. And then you have tag updates. So you can choose to allow or disallow your end users to update tags on resources associated with a provisioned product. Okay.
