 Airtubus Snowcone is a portable, rugged and secure device for edge computing and data transfer. Snowcone can send data to AWS in two ways, physically shipping the device back to the bus or utilizing it as data sync which runs on the device's computer. Snowcone comes in two variants, we have the eight terabyte version that uses hard disk drives, and the solid state or the Snowcone SSD which is utilizing solid state drives for 14 terabytes. Devices can run edge computing workloads that use EC2 instances. When they say EC2 instances, they mean that it's literally on the device. Small and light enough to carry in a backpack, use it with a battery based operation, a light workload at 25% CPU usage, the device can run on a battery for up to approximately six hours, use the Wi Fi interface to gather sensor data if you're in North America, everywhere else, good luck. Offering interface offers an interface with the network file system NFS supports Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Multiple layers of security encryption capabilities can be used in space constrained environments where Snowball edge devices don't fit, and collect IoT data using AWS IoT Greengrass. I've always wanted to try one of these out. But they've never been available in Canada, the snow family, but now apparently they are so maybe one day you'll see me making a video with one. Here is basically just a close up of it. So you might wonder like how do they ship this thing? Do they put it in a box? They don't have to because it has an E Ink shipping label. Basically, Snowball edge has the same thing as well. What's interesting is that it's just an Amazon Kindle. So I thought like, oh, okay, that's some integration. But then I read it's just an Amazon Kindle there. So that's interesting there. At the back, we have two rj 45 jacks, a USB C or USB C, PD use CP PD stands for power delivery. That's how you plug it in and charge it. So basically use a suitable power adapter that can supply at least 45 watts. So whatever that is, I wish they would, I would think that they would send you the cord with it, but I didn't look that up. So that might be something that is important to note. There's like a QR code on here. So I wonder if you get more information about the device on delivery. But there you go. That is a snow cone.
