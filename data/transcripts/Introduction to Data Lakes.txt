 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And we are taking a look at what data lakes are. So a data lake is a centralized data repo for structured and semi structured data. A data lake is intended to store vast amounts of data. data lakes generally use objects or files as its storage medium. So imagine here, we have our data lake, and it kind of looks like a lake, but it actually contains our data. And so the idea is that we're pulling data from various sources. And then the idea is that we can go ahead and transform that data into semi structured data or whatever we want to do with it. And then the idea is that people are sorry, we make our data available via programs or API's, or we can publish it to places generally with a data lake, you're going to end up publishing your data to a meta catalog. And if that sounds very similar to a native service that we know, there's a good reason for that. But yeah, hopefully that gives you an idea is that it's a centralized place to pull in a bunch of data, transform it, massage it, and then make it available for other services. Okay.
