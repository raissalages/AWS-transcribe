 Let's take a look here at core components for VPC. It's absolutely not all of them, as there's just so much going on in VPC. But these are what I consider core that you absolutely should know. Because they're just used so often. The first being internet gateway, often initializes IGW. This is a gateway that connects your VPC out to the internet. So if you don't have IGW, it's going to be hard to get internet. Then we have virtual private gateway. This is a VPN gateway. It's a way to connect your VPC to a private external network, really useful if you are you have your own data center or office that you need to connect securely to your VPC. We have route tables, this determines where to route traffic within a VPC. We have Nat gateway, this allows private instances. So virtual machines to connect to services outside of the VPC. I should note that Nat gateway is specifically for IPV for since IPV six, you don't necessarily need network addressing because all addresses are public. Then we have nachos. This is network access control lists. This acts as a stateless virtual firewall for compute within a VPC. And it operates at the subnet level with allow and deny rules. Then we have security groups, which doesn't really have its own icon. This acts as a stateful virtual firewall for compute within a VPC. It operates at the instance level with allow rules, we have public subnets. So this sub, these are subnets allow to have public IP addresses, then we have private subnets. These are subnets that disallow instances to have public IP addresses. We have VPC endpoints, these privately connect to AWS support services, we have VPC peering, this is connecting VPC to other VPCs. Again, there's a lot of stuff here. So you know, I didn't cover in here like ingress, there's like egress only internet gateway, which is for IPV six. There is a lot like transit transit peering or transit gateway, which is another form of VPC peering. So again, a lot of stuff there. But we do cover them in the course just I'm just trying to front load some stuff to you here. Technically, knackles and SGs are easy to network components. But we talked about before how VPC is so core to easy to they're kind of interchangeable. Because you see twos launch within VPCs. But there you go. Okay.
