 happy. As always, this course contains lecture contents and labs that you need to do in your own AWS account. The best way to pass is by getting practice exams and we have those we got a free one for you. And I want to point out that if you want to support more free cloud certification courses like this one, the best way is to go over to exampro.co and purchase the additional study materials, as that is how we are able to create this content for free. But yeah, if you don't know me, I've taught basically every type of cloud here on free code camp. We're talking GCP, AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, Terraform, you name it, I've taught it. And I want to thank everyone for
