 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And we're taking a look at AWS network firewall, which is a stateful managed network firewall, and also an intrusion detection intrusion protection systems for VPCs. It can filter outbound and inbound traffic at the perimeter of your VPCs, it can filter for your IGWs, for your nav gateways, for VPN traffic for Amazon Direct Connect traffic. And the way it is working is that it's utilizing this open source software underneath called Siri kata. I have no idea if that's how you how you pronounce it. So if anyone knows better, please tell me but Siri kata is this open source, ids IPS. And so the idea is that AWS is leveraging that underneath. And so you can use compatible rules. So either they're using that software or they're using something similar to it or emulating it, I'm not exactly sure. For AWS network firewall, it has multiple use cases, you can use it as a pass traffic through only from known service, service domains or IP address endpoints. You can use custom lists of bad domains to limit the types of domain names that your app can access. You can perform deep packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving the VPC. You can use stateful protect protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS, or an independent port is used. So there you go.
