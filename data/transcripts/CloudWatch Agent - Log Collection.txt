 and let's look at that in a bit more detail here. So the CloudWatch agent can send logs running or EC two instance to a CloudWatch log group. And to send logs, what you're going to have to do is configure the agent to include the logs that you want to send over the CloudWatch agent service needs to be restarted, the agents configuration file is located here. So if you're looking for where it is, that's where it's going to be located. And what you'll do is you're going to go ahead and edit it. So you can specify the location of the log file and the log group that you want it to be sent to. And this is how you restart it. So that's how you do log collection, you'll probably want to do that on your server.
