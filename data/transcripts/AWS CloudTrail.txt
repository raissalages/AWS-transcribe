 take a closer look here at AWS CloudTrail, because it's a very important service. So it's a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. And the idea is that every time you make an API call, it's going to show up as some kind of structured data that you can interact with or read through. So this cloud trail is used to monitor API calls and actions made on the database account, easily identify which users and accounts made the call to AWS. So you might have the where's the source IP address, the when the event time, the who the user agent, and the what the region resource and action. So I'm just gonna get my pen tool out here for a moment. And just notice you have the event time. So when it happened the source, the name, the region, the source IP address, the user agent, who was doing it. So here was LaForge, the response element. So you know, it's very clear what is going on here. And then you know, cloud trail is already logging by default, and we'll collect logs for the for the last 90 days via event history. If you need more than 90 days, you need to create a trail which is very common, you'll go into AWS and make one right away. trails are outputted to s3 and do not have gooey like event history. To analyze the trail, you have to use Amazon Athena. And I'm sure there are other ways to analyze it within AWS. But here's just what the event history looks like. So right off the bat, you can already see that there are information there. I'm not sure if they've updated the UI there, they might have, as even when I'm recording this, I kind of feel like if we go into the follow along, which we will, I bet they might have updated that the idea here is that you know, you can browse the last 90 days. But anything outside of that you're gonna have to do a little bit of work yourself. Okay.
