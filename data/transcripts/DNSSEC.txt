 domain name system security extensions DNS sec are a suite of extension specifications by the internet engineering task force for securing data exchange in domain name systems in internet protocol networks. So DNS sex signing lets DNS resolvers validate that a DNS response came from Amazon revenue three and has not been tampered with. This is a very simplified version. But the idea is that you will create a ks ks k signing key. And then you will enable DNS sec. I say this is a very, very simple example, because there is a lot involved here and the timing of it. And it's very tricky to do this. But generally, if you have a domain name, you should be using DNS sec, because this guarantees that people cannot impersonate your domain. So if you're using like something like SES, with AWS, they might force you to actually have to use it. Or if you are found not to be using the stuff, then maybe your domain will not be received by recipients and things like that. So this is something you definitely want to turn on. But it is a very complex process that what I'm showing here, okay.
