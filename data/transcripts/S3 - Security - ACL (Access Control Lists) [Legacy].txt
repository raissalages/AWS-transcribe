 let us talk about access control lists with an Amazon s3. So ACLs grant basic read write permissions to AWS other accounts, you can grant permissions only to other AWS accounts, you cannot grant permissions to users in your account, you cannot grant traditional conditional permissions, you cannot explicitly deny permission. So why does ACLs exist? Well, they've been traditionally used to allow other AWS accounts to upload objects to a bucket. But the thing about this feature is that it is a legacy feature. It was, this is before bucket policies, but it was wanted to make some way for other accounts to have easier access s3. So they came up with this feature. But nowadays, you wouldn't really have any reason to use it as there are more more robust ways to provide cross account access via bucket policies and access points. And to be honest, I can't remember even how this service works, because the only time I ever use it is when I'm making educational content. That's how few times it ever comes up in terms of practical use case. But we do need to know for the exam. The thing you want to remember with this is that it is like bucket policies, but way more limited. And it doesn't grant user access, it's for access between AWS accounts, and you do not have much controls over your permissions. If that makes sense. There you go.
