 So redshift configuration, you can set it up in two different cluster types. So you have single node, which is a great way to get started on redshift. If you don't have a lot of money, you want to play around, you can just launch a single node of 160 gigabytes, or you can launch in multi mode, multi node. And so when you launch a multi node, you always have a leader node, and then you have compute nodes. And you can add up to 128 compute nodes, you have a lot of computing power behind you. Now, I just want to point out that when you do spin up redshift and multi node, you're gonna see there's a maximum set of 32. And I just said there's 128. So what's going on here? Well, it's just one of those same defaults where AWS wants to be really sure that you want more than 32. Because you know, if you come in day one, someone hits 128, they want to make sure that they have the money to pay for it. So if you need more than 32 nodes, you just have to go as a list for a service limit increase.
