 Kinesis video streams is a fully managed service to stream live video from devices to AWS cloud or build applications for real time video processing or batch oriented videos. You have producers from things like security cams, webcams, mobile devices, and you have consumers like SageMaker recognition, or you can use things within SageMaker specifically like TensorFlow, or lots of stuff. So this is pretty straightforward. The only thing you need to know is that it can go out to ml services. Would you ever have to do a lab on this? Probably not. AWS courses never ever go deep in this one, but they want you to know what video streams is. So that is what it is. And there you go.
