 Alright, let's take a look here at internet gateway, also known as IGW, which allows both inbound and outbound traffic to your VPC operating on both IPv4 and IPv6. So here is our diagram where we have our IGW. And what's important to know is what we need in the route table. So even if we have an IGW that's associated with our VPC, we have to have these very particular routes. So the idea is that you need to have one for IPv4 and IPv6. And the target is going to be for the IGW. These you see here the 0.0.0.0.0 and the colon colon four, zero, you should remember because we had a slide on it dedicated to it. These are the catch all routes. This is what you want when you want to say allow anything or anything and everywhere. Okay, we always use the these with IGW to get out to the internet, you'll always see those no matter what features of IGW it works for both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, it provides a target in your VPC route tables for internet routable traffic that performs network address translation NATs, for instances that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses. NAT is not needed for IPv6 addresses because IPv6 addresses are all public default VPCs come with an IGW for non default VPCs you must manually create your IGW and associate it and create your route tables. It is that simple. There's not much more to say about IGWs. There you go.
