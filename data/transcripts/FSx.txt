 Amazon FFS, that's so hard to say, FSX allows you to deploy scale feature rich high performance file systems in the cloud. FFX, FXS supports a variety of files and protocols. I'm not going to reshoot the video. It's just really hard to say, okay. So the point is, is that there are different types of files and protocols you can utilize with this used to just have like one, and then it added two. And now there's four. Let's take a look at these four that we have. The first is for NetApp OnTap. So this is a proprietary enterprise storage platform known for handling petabytes of data. We have OpenZFS. This is an open source storage platform originally developed by Sun Microsystems. We have Windows File Server. So this is for Windows servers supporting native Windows features for Windows developers for file storage. We have Lustre, which is an open source file system for parallel computing. So those are the four for the exams, you're basically focusing on WFS. But OnTap is something that is used quite a bit with enterprises. So that is a good one in practicality to learn. But there you go.
