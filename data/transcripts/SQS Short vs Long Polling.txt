 Alright, let's compare short versus long polling. So polling is the method by which we retrieve messages from the queue. So short polling is our default. This returns messages immediately, even if the message queue being pulled is empty. For long polling, this is where we wait until messages arrive in the queue or till long pull timeout expires. You're using short polling when you need a message right away. You're using long polling when you need to save money by reducing how often you pull the way you set this is by setting the wait time seconds. Okay, so short polling is if it's set to zero, if it's greater than zero, then you're using long polling, and the max you can set for long polling is 20 seconds. So there you go.
