 Now, besides there being different cluster types, there's also different node types. And so we have two that are labeled here, we have DC, dense compute and dense storage DS, okay. And they are as what they say they are one is optimized for computing power, and one is optimized for storage. So you know, depending on your use case, you're going to choose what type of node you want. Notice that there are no smalls or micros, we all we only start at large here. Because if you're doing redshift, you're working with large amounts of data. So you know, that makes total sense.
