 VPC peering allows you to connect one VPC with another over a direct network route using a private IP address. So imagine you have two VPCs, you want them to be able to share traffic between them as if they're one VPC. And that's what VPC peering connections can allow us to do. So VPC peering connections is not a gateway. It's not a VPN connection. It does not rely on a separate piece of physical hardware. There's no single point of failure for communication or a bandwidth bottleneck. So it's very simple way to set up VPC peering. And so VPC peering can be between an IPv4 or IPv6 address instances on pure VPCs behave just like they're on the same network. They connect VPCs across the same or different AWS accounts and regions. Peering uses a star configuration. So you have one central VPC and four other VPCs. You can see that it is a little bit more limited than transit gateway, which is like VPC peering on steroids, as you can have like something like 50,000 or crazy amount of VPCs. But for this, it's very simple. There's no transitive peering. So peering must take place between VPCs. Again, if you want transitive peering, use transit gateway, it needs. Yeah, it needs a one to one connect to the immediate VPC. For transit appearing use a bus transit gateway, as I said here, it has no overlapping cider block. So you don't want to have, it's not going to work if you have overlapping ones, data transfer across daisy or cross region incurs charges. So if it's within the same AZ, no charges, but in all those other cases, there's going to be a charge, the way you're going configure VBCs, you're going to create the peering connection, you're going to accept the peering connection, you're going to enable the routing of traffic between the two VBCs, they say that this is optional. But to me, it seems like you would really want to add these routes into your route table so that they can accept traffic from each other, or be not just accept, but actually just be able to do it. One other thing that we want to point out is that if you can update, you can update the inbound or outbound rule of your VBC security groups to reference security groups and peer VBCs. Because if you're going to have two peer VBCs, referencing a security group, another one is going to be a very common use case. And so I wanted to include that in here. So here we are describing security group reference from another one. So there's a very dedicated command line to go find that. And so that way, you're able to grab the ID so that you can utilize it. But there you go.
