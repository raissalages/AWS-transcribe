 cover access grants. So s3 access grants lets you map identities in a directory service. So think I am identity center, Active Directory, Okta, to access data in s3. This is really useful if you know, people just want to give them easy access, and they're already using some kind of directory service. So there are some components that we should know about. The first thing is the access grant instance, this is the logical container for individual grants, then you have the location. So you're saying, hey, I'm going to let all s3 buckets or this subsection of three buckets to have access, then you have your granular permissions, which are your grants, you can have multiple grants, this is going to determine whether it's read, write, or both. Whether you're giving access to an IAM role or an IAM user, and specific objects in a bucket, you'll get issued out temporary credentials to keep things really secure. There's more that we can talk about access grants. The reason I'm not getting really deep into this is because this stuff gets really complicated, it's probably not going to show up the exam and directory services are paying to explain. So just understand that Amazon s3 access grants let you map identities in a directory service, a member of the terms Active Directory, Okta, identity service, and or Microsoft on try D, which is Azure Active Directory is a new name. And then you'll understand what this service is for. Okay. Remember earlier when I was talking about block public access, and I was saying that
