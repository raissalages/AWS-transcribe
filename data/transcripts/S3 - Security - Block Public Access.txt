 Let's talk about block public access for s3. As this is probably the most important security feature that you need to know about s3. And this is a safety feature that is enabled by default to block all public access to an s3 bucket because the number one security misconfiguration is s3 buckets when when people have a nominous access or unrestricted access to your s3 buckets. So it was has made really, really sure that that this is not going to happen to you. And they have way more than just this single measure to detect and tell you about whether you have open buckets. But there are four options that we have here. So we have block all public access. But once we check that off, we can kind of narrow down exactly what we want to have it for. So they have a checkbox for whether you have new access control lists and whether they're allowed to have public access, that it could be for any control lists, that it's only for new bucket policies or access points, or any bucket policies or access points, it used to just be for new bucket policies, any bucket policies, but then they add access points, they lump them together, I'm not sure why they didn't make six checkboxes, but that's what they wanted to do. So very straightforward, the times that we're going to be turning off block public access is when we want to give anonymous access. That could be, you know, when you are trying to provide static website hosting, or you want people to publicly able to download read only files from s3. So there are a few use cases, but more more or less, you can work around that issue by having cloud front in front of it and reduce your security risk there. But I just want to point out that access points, s3 access points, which we'll talk about, it's a it's a separate feature of s3 can have their own independent block public access settings, which we'll see when we get to that section. Okay.
