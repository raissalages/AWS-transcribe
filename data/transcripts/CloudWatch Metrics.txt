 Alright, so we're on to cloud metrics. And this represents a time ordered set of data points. And it's a variable that is monitored over time. So CloudWatch comes with many predefined metrics that are generally namespaced by a service. So specifically, for an EC two instance, we already have some metrics like CPU utilization, discrete ops, disk write ops, disk read bytes, disk write bytes, network in network out network packets in. And there could be even more, but let's just take a look here and network packets out. Let's just take a look at where this would go. So if you were to look in your metrics, you could choose based on the category. And so that's where we went to easy to, we would choose network in there. And then we could see that information over time for networking on a particular resource. So there you go. Now let's take a look
