 So enhance fan out allows up to 20 consumers to receive records from a stream without with sorry with throughput of two megabytes of data per second per shard. And so the docs they talk about like, okay, we have this diagram that sends data to different things, and it fans out. So it's, it's more than one shard sending data at a time. And that's all great and all but all you need to know really is that the consumers that utilize EFO have dedicated throughput per consumer. And so that means that you aren't sharing the capacity between consumers, which is really useful if you need a guarantee of throughput. And so confused consumers must be configured using the KCL. That's the communities client library, or the streams API to utilize EFO. So this involves Java and is not particularly easy to do. So just understand that you'll have to learn how to write Java. Okay.
