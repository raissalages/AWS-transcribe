 IP v6 was developed to provide a solution for the eventual exhaustion of an ipv4 address and it about services provide support for ipv6 but its configuration access will vary per service. If you've not seen what an ipv6 address looks like, it looks like that you can see it's really long and it serves that purpose to make sure that there is an endless supply of addresses. A service will be configured for either and we're talking in the context of IP v6 support, but either have support specifically for a dedicated, a dedicated way for ipv6 only, or it will be dual stack. That doesn't mean that there aren't endpoints for ipv4 only and then dual stack or then ipv6. I'm just talking about the ipv6 support additional to what we normally have a service endpoint is the way to access ipv6. And so will either have public endpoint support and or pi private endpoint support. So note that all end of the services support ipv4 not all services or the resources have ipv6 turned on by default. So there might be some work that you'll need to do here. Okay.
