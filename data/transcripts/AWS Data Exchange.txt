 Andrew Brown, and we are taking a look at AWS data exchange. So AWS data exchange is a catalog of third party data sets, you can download for free, subscribe or purchase data sets, examples could be something like COVID-19 foot traffic data, IMDb, TV, and movie data, historical weather data. And so you have this giant catalog, it's basically a marketplace of data that you can purchase, you can upload your own data sets, and sell them in the AWS marketplace, there are a lot of requirements in order to do that. But that is something that you could do. They have this concept of data grants, which allows you to control access to your data sets, data sets, pricing can be free, upfront commitment, usage base, which is basically your subscription. There's this thing called open data on AWS program, which is a collection of 300 free and publicly available data sets. Basically, these are just open s3 buckets that we can go access, there's not a whole lot to say about the service other than it's like a bunch of data. And most of them is just data in an s3 bucket that you are paying to get access to. Okay.
