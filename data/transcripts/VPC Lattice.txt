 Amazon VPC lattice is a fully managed application networking service that you use to connect, secure and monitor the services for your application. And if that doesn't make any sense, I have a more human readable description, which is easily turn your AWS resources into services for a microservice architecture. This is a game changer because if you've ever wanted to utilize microservice architecture, but you found doing mutual authentication, very difficult or setting up Kubernetes very difficult, you kind of get this fully managed version by AWS that can get you kind of comfortable with the idea of microservices. So this works with a single VPC works with multiple VPCs, you can use it across accounts, you can be used with multiple accounts, it performs NAT for IPv4, IPv6, and overlapping networks. Now you've heard me say before that IPv6 doesn't need a NAT, but it does need a NAT if you are taking traffic that is from IPv4 to IPv6, or vice versa. So that's what that NAT is doing. It integrates with I am we have weight routing for traffic such as blue, green or carry canary style deploys. It uses HTTP, HTTPS for the service to service communication. And this is where we hit our limitations. Because when you look at microservice architectures, they like to communicate with things like GCPR, GRCP, I always forget the additional ism. RCP, G RCP, G RPC, there we go. It supports custom domains, which is very useful, you can bring your own SSL and TLS certificate. This also really replaces probably it probably leverages underneath but like service mesh. So a service mesh was just not a very good service. There was service mesh and cloud map when I used to when we used to do those kind of microservice architectures when we did the cloud project boot camp, and this was not out yet. And I wish it was because it would have made our lives a lot easier. Here's an example of the components. So you have your service network, that's the logical container for all your stuff. It can be associated with multiple VPCs. As far as I understand, you have listeners. So this is starting to look a lot like what do you call it? load balancers. But just understand these listeners and these rules are not the same thing as application load balancer. So you have a protocol report to listen to what you want to listen to, you can have up to two listeners per service, a listener contains writing rules and has a default route. So very similar to application load balancer, you have a target group, this is a collection of resources for a very specified type. So they can all be C two or all IP addresses are all lambda functions are all a LBS. It says k pods in the documentation. But when you go and choose the options, it's not there. So I imagine you are choosing k pods, based on IP addresses or something else. So there's something else going on there. And hopefully, you can see that I'm trying to represent each target group as very unique things here. And then there's service directory. So a central registry for all VPC lattice services that you own, and are shared with your account through the AWS Resource Access Manager. So AWS RAM, I don't really have a dedicated section of RAM in this in this course. But you know, we'll just keep coming back to RAM because other services seem to keep utilizing it in interesting ways. But there you go.
