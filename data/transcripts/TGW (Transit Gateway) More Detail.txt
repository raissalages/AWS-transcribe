 A transit gateway is a network transit hub that you can use to interconnect your virtual private cloud or VPC and on premise networks. So transit gateway leverages AWS Resource Manager, it operates as a virtual router at the regional level, you can attach up to 5000 VPCs to each gateway. And for each connection you're making to each VPC is going to spin up an E&I that's how it's going to do that VPC to transit gateway communication. I think that's kind of important because that could factor into costs or hitting particular limitations if you are restricted on the amount of E&I as you have your VPC. Each attachment can handle up to 50 gigabits per second of traffic, you can attach your AWS VPN connections to a transit gateway, you can attach direct connect connections to a transit gateway, you can attach third party virtual appliances via transit gateway attachments. And this can be a source and destination for packets. So it's bi directional, you can peer connections with other transit gateways that you can do a lot with transit gateways. And I do have a diagram, it's in the next slide, I could not fit it on this slide here at all. But I just want to point out third party virtual appliances. We talk about these when we talk about gateway load balancer, the idea is that you have, let's say a virtual machine, it runs some kind of security security service, and all your traffic passes through it to, you know, filter out traffic or do whatever kind of modern inter detection. So the point is that transit gateway can serve that as well. But you can also use gateway load balancer in different scenarios. But here is the diagram, I could not be bothered to make my own, I grabbed this again from the documentation as it seemed to cover all the cases. But the idea is that imagine you have transit gateway here, and you're able to connect multiple VPCs so that they can talk to each other. The great advantage is that it's a hub and spoke model. So you can just connect as much as you want. And they can talk through there, you can obviously connect it with direct connect, as it's showing there, you can use a transit gateway peering to appear to another transit gateway. So you can connect a bunch of VPCs between two transit gateways, you can see that it's going to this virtual appliance here. So that's a possible connection, you'd use that doesn't show it here. But there's that transit gateway attachment, which would be intermediate. And then they're kind of representing the the cloud WAN, right, because we said that cloud WAN can get into there, or you bring your connect your on premise network through a VPC to your transit gateway. So a lot going on there. But my point is, is that transit gateway is a lot more flexible than your standard peering. But yeah, you have VPCs, then you have your VPC pairing, then you have transit gateway, and then you have VPC lattice, which is more specialized. So you can see that there are a lot of cloud services that do similar things, you just got to choose what's going to work for you. Okay.
