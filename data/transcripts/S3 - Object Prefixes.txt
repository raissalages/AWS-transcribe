 s3 object prefixes are strings that precede the object file name, and it's part of the object key name. So this whole thing is an object key name, this part is the prefix, this part is the file name. Since all objects in a bucket are stored in a flat structured hierarchy, object prefixes allow for a way to organize group and filter objects. So this is the way we get folders, and we talked about folders in another slide. A prefix uses the forward slash delimitator to group similar data, similar to directories or folders or sub directories, prefixes are not true folders. When we're talking about general purpose buckets for the directory bucket type, I have no idea as it is such a new bucket type when I'm recording this. So I'm not sure exactly how it works. But there is no limit for the number of delimitators. The only limit is the object key name cannot exceed 1024 bytes with the object prefix and the file name combined. So yeah, there's no limit in terms of delimitators. I don't know if you can make you probably make delimiters that are literally one character long. So you could make as many as you could fit in there if you like. But it's not limited on the delimitators or sub folders. It's based on that byte size. There you go. Hey,
