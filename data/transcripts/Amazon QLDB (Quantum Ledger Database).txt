 variable transaction logs when you need to record the history of financial activities that can be trusted. Here are the features. Immutable logs. Data cannot be altered or deleted after entry, ensuring permanent records. Cryptographic verification utilizes SHA-256 hashing for secure, verifiable transaction histories. Fully managed automated management of infrastructure, which allows users to focus on app development without worrying about underlying hardware. It's serverless, so scales automatically with app demands enhancing efficiency. SQL-like queries support party QL. I do think there's a proper way to pronounce that. Particle. Particle. That's what it is. Not party QL. For flexible SQL compatible data querying. Central governance managed under a central trusted authority, ideal for apps needing a reliable transactional log, high throughput and scalability designed for rapid and frequent updates with minimal latency. And this integration works seamlessly with other AWS services for improved functionality, simple management, as a transactions, journal storage. Now, no diagrams, no nothing here, because this is not a service that's going to come up a lot on exams. If you wanted to use this in practicality, it's actually really easy to set up a ledger. But to work with it is a lot harder. There is a JavaScript, a web server with nest that works with quantum ledger database. So we could do that. But again, I don't think the time is spent here. So unless you see me make a lab, this is all you need to know is what it does. Okay.
