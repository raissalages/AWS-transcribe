 Amazon forecast is a time series forecasting service, and it will forecast business outcomes such as product demand resources, or financial performance. So you need to upload your data set into s3 with historical data, and possibly additional metadata. Once you're all done working through this entire process, it'll actually generate a visual graph, you could download the data. Let's talk about the general workflow of how you're going to use Amazon forecast, you're going to create a data set group and import your data, you'll have to define a schema register the task, you'll create predictors get accurate metrics, you will have to create an ELT job to evaluate the model, choose a predefined backtest, create your forecast, deploy the predictor, and then retrain with the full when when we say we're deploying with a predictor. Now it's be it is trained with the full data set. And then we can query it, I found the service the flow to be very similar to Amazon personalized, but things are named a little bit differently. But when you start working with these AI services, you'll start noticing a pattern in terms of what you need to do, but they'll name the stuff differently. Okay.
