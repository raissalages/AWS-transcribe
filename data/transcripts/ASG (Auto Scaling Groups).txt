 Hey, this is Andrew Brown and we are taking a look at auto scaling groups. So an ASG contains a collection of EC two instances that are treated as a group for the purpose of automatic scaling and management, specifically horizontal scaling as it is just adding and removing instances. automatic scaling can occur in a few different ways when you're using ESG's, you have capacity settings where you set the expected range of capacity where you can and this would be called manual scaling, we have health check replacements, where it will determine if the instance is unhealthy is going to replace it. So we have EC two or ELB health checks that we can utilize with ASG's. And we have scaling policies, these set complex rules to determine when to scale up or down. And we have simple scaling, step scaling, target tracking, scaling, predictive scaling. And I think that's all of them there. I just want to point out that ASG's are used to scale easy to instances. So if you're using ECS, and the underlying compute is easy to you can use as G's, if you are utilizing EKS, which is Kubernetes, and it's utilizing EC two instances underneath, those can utilize as use as well. Fargate does not utilize ASG's. It might internally so AWS might be utilizing it. But from a customer perspective, Fargate is fully fully managed serverless containers. And so it just automatically scales. So hopefully that makes sense. What would be a use case for as G's? Well, here's a diagram. And let's just walk through it. So imagine you have a burst of traffic that that is coming into our domain, I'm just gonna get our pen out here. So I can just kind of follow along here. So up here, okay, roughly three, we'll point that to our load balancer over here. Our load balancer passes the traffic to our target groups, which is over here. The target group is associated with our ASG and sends the traffic to the instance registered with our ASG. Okay, over here, the SG scaling policy will check if our instances are near capacity. And then the scaling policy determines we need another instance. And it launches a new EC two instance with the associated launch configuration to our SG. Now this is scaling policy. So that is the that's one way scaling occurs, but we will make sense of all this as we go through it. Okay. Transcribed by https://otter.ai
