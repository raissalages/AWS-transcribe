 If you want to send large messages to an SQS queue, you're going to need the SQS extended client library for Java and Python. If this sounds familiar, we had something very similar for SNS. So it's pretty much the same process here. It's hosted on GitHub, AWS lab, the GitHub page. And the idea here is that we are going to have to utilize an S3 bucket. These libraries are useful for messages that are larger than 256 kilobytes, and can go up to two gigabytes. Both libraries save the actual payload to an S3 bucket and publish the reference of the stored S3 object to the SNS topic. Some interesting things to note, and this is going to be for the same one as well. The idea is that you are telling the telling the topic that it's going to be handling a large payload for this specific bucket, you can even tell it to leave it on so that every time you're utilizing the SDK, it's always going to send it to S3. Otherwise, it's just going to do it for that single request. So there you go.
