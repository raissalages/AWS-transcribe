 So am QP, which stands for advanced messaging, querying protocol is an open standard wire level protocol designed for messaging middleware that enables conforming client apps to communicate with conforming messaging middleware servers. So the idea is that you're going to have a broker am q, am q p broker, that could be something like rabbit MQ or active MQ. That's why they have the MQ in the name because it implies that they're using this protocol. And you can see components here. So the idea is that messages are published to exchanges, exchanges distribute message copies to queues using rules called bindings. We have the broker which pushes messages to the subscribe consumers, or you can have consumers which pull messages from the queue. Okay, messages can have metadata attached to them. Messages are only removed from the queue when a consumer acts. The broker act is short for acknowledgement. That's a coding term. There are four types of exchanges that am q p, am q p supports. We have direct exchange, which is the simplest method, we have fanon exchange, which will send it to all the, I suppose the consumers. So that one's highly available and effective. We have topic exchange, if you want to have a pub sub kind of model, and then you have header exchange. So hopefully that is clear. The way we're going to implement this is we need some kind of SDK. So bunny is specifically for rabbit MQ. In fact, in the follow alongs, I tried to use this with active MQ and it did not work. It might have worked, but it did not seem to work. So there might have been some specific things to rabbit MQ here. But this is an example here, notice that we are creating a channel, we are setting up a queue, we are getting an exchange, we are publishing a message. So understand those components that are for MQP. Here's an example of subscribing. It's very similar. But notice that we're doing q dot subscribe. So not completely different. There you go.
