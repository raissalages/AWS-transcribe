 So something that I think is very important to know about IPv6 is what does the migration path look like when we are utilizing a VPC, a VPC that only is using IPv4. So you can migrate it over to dual stack. But there are some steps to it. The first step to move over to dual stack is you'll need to add a new IPv6 cider block to the VPC, you need to need to create or associate an IPv6 subnets. IPv4 subnets can can't be migrated. So you're just going to have subnets for IPv4 and subnets for IPv6, you'll need to update the route table for IPv6 to I to the IGW. So it's adding that colon colon forward slash zero up to the internet, you'll need to upgrade security group rules to include the IPv6 addresses as well, you'll need to migrate EC two instance types if it does not support IPv6. So most EC two instances support IPv6. But there could be ones that do not, such as legacy ones or specialized ones, you cannot disable IPv4 support for your VPC and subnets. This is the default IP addressing system for VPC and EC two. But you can make them dual stack. So there you go.
