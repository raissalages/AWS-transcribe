So retention period is how long data will remain in the stream until it's released, which is a nice way of saying deleted data persist for 24 hours by default, if you if you want, you can change that to be up to maximum 365 days, it's actually based on hours, but it's easy to remember a year up to a year, okay? Additional charges for retention periods greater than 24 hours. So anyway, over 24 hours, you're gonna get charged more. So if you want something longer, just look up the costs on that. The retention can be adjusted using the CLI via the increased stream retention period and the decreased stream retention period. So you can adjust this. One caveat of this is that when you do change it, it's not instantaneous, it takes several minutes. So data that is that is already in flight going to the from producers to the stream, it's going to have that old retention period. Okay. So that is something you'll have to consider. Let's take a look at the
