 Amazon CodeGuru is a machine learning code analysis service. CodeGuru performs code reviews and will suggest changes to improve the quality of your code. It can show visual profiles, show the internals of your code to pinpoint performance. CodeGuru has three services, the security service, which has different kinds of scans that can perform, the profiler, which will find and fix inefficiencies in your code, and the code reviewer, which will associate a repo for continuous code change recommendations. It supports the following language, Java, JavaScript, Python, C sharp, typescript, Ruby, go IC formats. But in reality, it really is just Python and Java. Because when I went ahead and did the labs, I know it said it supported everything for security. But when it came down to the profile profiler, that was not the same case and the reviewer to use some of these, you'll actually end up having to use GitHub actions if you're using GitHub as your get repo when you're doing CI CD. So yeah, that's Amazon CodeGuru not my favorite service, but it is something we need to cover. Okay.
