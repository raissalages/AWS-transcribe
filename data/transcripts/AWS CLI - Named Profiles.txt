 So the AWS config files support the ability to have multiple profiles, profiles allow you to switch between different configurations quickly for different environments. And basically, when we say different environments, that could be with different permissions or different accounts. So imagine we want to run the command in a bus easy to describe hyphen instances. Well, what it's going to do is it's going to look for that credentials file or your configuration file, and it's going to look for the default profile. And that is what it's going to use as the key and secret for that. So you can choose not to have a default profile and actually leaving out the default profile is a good practice because then you are always explicitly saying I want to use this profile and you don't accidentally use whatever the default is. If you want to specify which profile you're using, there's this hyphen hyphen profile flag. So you can choose what it is. If you don't want to do that, and you want to set it via an environment variable, you can go ahead and export it and set it that way. In local developer environments, setting credential files and using name profiles happen frequently. In a lot of the fall longs, I'm using a cloud developer environment. And they don't like you using credential files there because you're not supposed to store them on machines. So you're not going to see me utilizing this much. But in local development, you'll probably use it all the time on your own machine. And I just want to point that out. Okay.
