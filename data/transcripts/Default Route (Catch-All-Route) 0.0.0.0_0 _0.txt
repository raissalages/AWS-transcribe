 The default route or catch all route represents all possible IP addresses. And you can think of this route as giving access from anywhere or to the internet without restriction. There is a IPv4 version of this default route and an IPv6 version of this route, since IPv6 is becoming more prevalent, prevalent, however you want to say that word more common cloud providers are charging for IPv4, forcing you to consider IPv6. So it's important to learn both of them. So for IPv4, it looks like this 0.0 dot 0.0, forward slash zero. And for IPv6, it looks like this colon colon forward slash zero. Why is the IPv6 just colon colon? Well, if you've ever seen an IPv6 address, you know, they are super long. And so they came up with a shorthand, which is the double colon to represent all those zeros and hyphens. When you specify, let's say a route in your route table for the IGW, you're going to be putting 0.0 dot 0.0, forward slash zero, to get out to the internet. When we specify in our security group, we would do it in our inbound rules, we're allowing all traffic from the internet to access our public resources. So those are just two examples. When you are creating routes, you will have to create a route for the IPv4 and the IPv6 for both of these use cases where whether it's a route table or security group, so just be aware of that. But there you go. Okay.
