 Another way we can scale is based off of health check replacements. So here we have an example of a health check replacement. This is when the SG replaces an instance, if it's considered unhealthy, and there are two types of health checks as G's can perform. The first is easy to health check if the EC two instance fails, either of its health, EC two status checks, then it's going to get replaced. This one is not very useful in practicality. But if you're not using the ELB, you can't take advantage of the ELB health checks. But I would say that often when you're using SG, you're going to have an application load balancer or something attached to it. So for the ELB health checks, issue will perform a health check based on the ELB health check, and ELB will ping an HTTP endpoint at a specific path port and status code. So look at the example below. As you can see, I'm gonna get my pen out here. So we can just kind of narrow in here. But the idea is that we say to use the health check ELB. And then we're specifying the subnets and the subnets have to be the same subnets as the the load balancer, okay, as the SG, so pretty straightforward. And of course, you configure the health check on the ELB not on the SG. If that makes sense. Okay.
