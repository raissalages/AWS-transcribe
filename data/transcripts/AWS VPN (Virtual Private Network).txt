 As VPN lets you establish a secure and private tunnel from your network or device to the AWS global network. This is a slide that I used in the cloud petitioner. So not super exciting, but it does point out the two things that we need to learn about which we are definitely going to cover. The first is the site to site VPN, which securely connects on premise network or branch offices sites to VPC and the inverse client VPN that securely connects users to the AWS or on premise networks. One thing I'd like to cover is IP sec because there's not really anywhere else to talk about it. So I threw it in here. So IP sec, which stands for internet protocol security is a secure network protocol suite that authenticates and encrypts the packets of data to provide secure encrypted communication between two computers over the IP network is used in VPN. So if you're using VPNs, you're going to get that secure connection. And the reason why you need VPNs is to get that secure connection. So if you're using direct connect, which is a private connection, it's not necessarily secure and so you need that additional layer to get that if that makes sense. But let's get into these two site to site VPN and it was client VPN. Okay.
