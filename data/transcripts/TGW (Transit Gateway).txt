 A transit gateway is a transit hub that you can use to interconnect your VBCs and your on premise network. This is just a very straightforward slide to be able to show you a diagram, I couldn't be bothered to make one, I just grabbed it from the documentation. But I just want to know that you can substitute your virtual private gateway for a transit gateway transit gateways, there's a lot more to them than just a single slide. And we have a separate section on transit gateway, as it is a hub and spoke way of connecting multiple VBCs to one one way of communicating. But the reason I want to give this extra emphasis is that transit gateways can support support both IPv4 traffic, and IPv6 traffic inside the VPN tunnels. So if you need IPv6, you're going to use transit gateway. So yeah, there's my extra emphasis there for you. Okay.
