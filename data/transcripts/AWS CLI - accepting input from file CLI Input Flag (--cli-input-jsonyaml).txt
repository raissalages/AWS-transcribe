 So in the last slide, we're talking about generating out a skeleton file. And so the question is, how do we actually utilize that in future commands, and that's where we use the input flag. So the idea here is that we're going to pass that file back to the CLI. And the idea is that we don't have to supply all of those parameters, because it's going to get auto filled by that file. So you have to check every single sub command because you have to see if they actually allow you to mass set values. And so it will have a flag like CLI input JSON or CLI input yaml, it might have both, it might only have one for yaml or one for JSON. So just double check the docs. But this is a super powerful feature that again, I really wish I'd use it a lot more. Okay.
