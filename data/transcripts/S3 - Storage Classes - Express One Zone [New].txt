 Amazon s3 Express one zone delivers consistent single digit millisecond data access for your most frequently accessed data and latency sensitive applications. This particular class gives you the lowest latency out of every single storage class, it is 10 times faster than s3 standard, it costs 50% lower than s3 standard. So it is really, really, really cost effective. The data is stored in a user selected single availability zone as it says one zone, so it only is in one zone. The data is in stored in a new type of bucket called an Amazon s3 directory bucket. For this type of bucket, it supports simple real folder structure, which is not the norm for s3 buckets, where you're only allowed to have 10 by default in your entire account. So generally, when we talk about s3 buckets, we say they don't actually have real folders, this one has real folders. Express one zone applies a flat rate request per charge for request sizes up to 512 kilobytes. So even though it is 50% lower than s3 standard, it does have this one caveat of expense. I don't know if I mentioned it in standard IA, but standard IA, I think has a reduction cost of 50% to s3 standard, we covered other places here. So if I miss it, it's okay, we'll cover it two, three times over. But just understand that this thing is super, super fast. But you know, it does have that exotic bucket type. And it does have that additional charge. So you have to factor those in. Okay.
