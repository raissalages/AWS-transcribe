 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And we are taking a look at AWS glue. I believe it was glued on Amazon glue. But it was glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy for analytics users to discover, prepare, move and integrate data from multiple sources. When this thing first came out, it was junk for years. And they have really done a lot of work to make this a much more powerful tool. It's a much more important tool in the AWS ecosystem that I think is worth knowing because it does a lot of integrations between data services. So you definitely need to know this one inside and out. The use cases for this one is analytics, machine learning, application development, you can discover and connect to more than 70 diverse data sources and manage your data to a centralized data catalog. I just recently found out you can visually create run and monitor ETLs to load your data into your data lakes. I almost wonder if it was did this because Azure had such a great offering for this. So maybe they are trying to be competitive with Azure synapse, I believe that one it's called for visual ETLs. You can immediately search and query catalogs data using Amazon Athena. And with Athena, you'll notice there's very strong integrations with it. We have EMR, Redshift spectrum, what can it do? It does data discovery, modern ETL, or ELT, cleansing, transforming data, it's centralized cataloging. So it does a bit more than just one thing. And so you'll notice there's a couple things that AWS glue does. Okay.
