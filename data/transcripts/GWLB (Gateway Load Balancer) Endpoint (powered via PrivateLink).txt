 Gateway load balancer endpoints are powered via private link and allows you to distribute traffic to a fleet of network virtual clients. So kind of similar to our previous diagrams, but this one is a little bit more funky, because the idea is that you have an ENI which acts as your your endpoint for the gateway load balancer. The idea is you have traffic coming in from the internet possibly, and then you are sending it over to the gateway load balancer that says endpoint, but really, it's just a load balancer, I just forgot to take the word endpoint out of there. And then it's going to go to your virtual appliances, I wrote security appliances, because that's commonly what you're going to have here. And the idea is that traffic is going to flow back. And it's going to then go to your workload. And so the idea is that you're adding a layer of security or filter before stuff reaches your stuff. And it allows you to use third party appliances, whether you deploy your own, or whether you use one that is provided by a third party provider. So deploy scale and manage firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, deep packet inspection systems, you can obtain virtual appliances as a service from the AWS partner network, the APN, or the AWS marketplace, you can send traffic to the GLB by making making a simple configuration update in your VPC route tables, because you will obviously have to tell it to route to the gateway load balancer. But there you go.
