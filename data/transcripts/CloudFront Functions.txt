 Let's take a look here at CloudFront functions. These are lightweight edge look edge functions for high scale latency sensitive CDN customization. CloudFront functions are cheaper, faster, but more limited than the lambda edge functions. So there are two functions for CloudFront functions, you get the view request, and the viewer response. The only support language at this time is ECMA script 5.1 JavaScript, these functions are deployed at the edge location, so they're much closer to the end user use cases here would be cache key normalization, header manipulation, status code modification, body generation, your redirects or rewrites request authorization. So there is overlap for these things, okay, with lambda edges use cases, but here's a few requests redirect HTTP, HTTPS, we saw this before, but I'm just showing you what it looks like in that ECMA script 5.1 JavaScript. And then here's the viewer response and we're just adding some security headers. So there you go.
