 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And we are taking a look at it was lambda. So it was lambda is a serverless function as a service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. I just want to make great make extra emphasis here about how lambda is serverless. And it is a function as a service just because something's a function as a service doesn't automatically make it serverless. It just happens to be that AWS is offering is that okay, lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically to a few 1000 lambda functions concurrently in seconds, you pay for the compute time you consume, there is no charge. When your code is not running, I have an asterik there because AWS lambda throughout the years have added additional functionality where it will continuously run to avoid cold starts. But generally, you're not charged if your code is not running, okay. It was lambda supports multiple runtimes, we got Ruby, Python, Java, go PowerShell, no j s, C sharp, rust, or create your own custom environment. For going rust, it's a little bit questionable because you're really just building a binary and placing them on there. But these are the common languages you can use, you can definitely use more than just this. Let's look at a couple of use cases for lambda. But lambda can often be used to glue different services together. An example would be processing thumbnail. So the idea is that you have a file you put into an S3 bucket that triggers a lambda passes the image along, you process it, you place it back into a bucket. Another thing you do is utilize it as a contact form. So you have a website, you submit a request over to API gateway, API gateway points to a lambda, the lambda processes it, and we'll insert it into a DynamoDB database and then send an SNS notification saying that an email has been received. So you better go take a look at it. When you use it as lambda via the it was management console, they have an interface. So you can definitely just utilize that if you want. This is actually cloud nine underneath, you choose your runtime, you upload your code, you choose your triggers, your destinations, you will have to configure your IAM role for permissions to send to stuff or get stuff from other places. So understand that
