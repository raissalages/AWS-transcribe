 So AWS publishes all of their IP address ranges at a very specific URL. And it returns back this information in JSON format. So you can open your browser and place it right in there. And you'll get back a bunch of ranges for IP addresses based on region and possibly other parameters. Why would you want these? Well, some organizations might need to have these IP ranges for their internal networking devices, and to add them to their allow list, so that they can access these services. This is more of an issue for larger organizations. But I just wanted to make it clear that they have this address here. And the idea is that you could use a curl as simple as that. And, you know, download the JSON results, then I'm passing it to a program called j q, which is for parsing JSON. And I'm saying just return back the IP ranges for CA central one, specifically for the code build service. And then you can see down below here that I have those IP address ranges. So that's just kind of a cool little thing to know. Okay.
