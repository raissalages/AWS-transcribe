 Okay, so we have all the S three storage classes that I could fit in here, the only one that's not here is reduced redundancy storage, the intelligent tearing have their own access here, but they're reutilizing existing tiers in here. So I'm not going to include them redundantly here. Let's talk about this matrix. It's not perfect, but it was the best way I could fit everything into one screen. So durability, as I promised is 11 nines across the board. Notice I highlighted the one zones, because they're special, they operate in a single AZ. And because of that, yes, they have 11 nines of durability in that AZ because they're replicating copies of the data in that single AZ. But if that whole AZ goes out, you're going to lose that data. So from that perspective, from a multi AZ perspective, it's not as durable, but it still gets 11 nines technically, for availability, it obviously varies standard is the highest, then we have intelligent tearing, which it says 99.9. But I think it's going to be really dependent on whatever it's utilizing underneath. For standard AI, it has 99.9 for glacier incidence 99.9, then the one zones are going to drop to one zone is point five, and this one is point 95. So I don't think that's a mistake. I think it is point five on that one. Glacier flexible archive, they don't specify, because you don't get them immediately, right? You get them minutes later. So it's not really the same level of availability. And that's why we mark them as na. For AZs, everything pretty much operates in three or more with the exception of the one zones. For minimum capacity charge per object, standard IA and one zone IA is going to have 128 kilobytes. In fact, I think you have to have at least 120 kilobytes for these, these ones in particular Friday, for flexible and deep archive, these ones are a bit special, because that's coming from the metadata. And it's on top of whatever you're putting in there. So it's not, oh, I'm only going to put a 40 kilobyte file in it's, I put a file in, it's going to add 40 kilobytes to the file. So that is something that is happening there for minimum storage duration, for intelligent tearing, at least 30 days, because it has to analyze the file for 30 days before it can move it to somewhere else. As far as I understand, that's how it works. I could be wrong on that where it's not 100%, you're going to be charged for 30 days. But for this to be effective, it needs to be in there for 30 days to move it to another tier. For standard IA and one zone IA, you have to have them for 30 days, if you put an object in there, and you try to take it out, you're going to get still charged 30 days. For instant and flexible, it's 90 days for glacier deep archive, it's a minimum of 180 days. And you know, if you lock down your stuff, right, it's going to you can't get it out there for you're going to pay whatever the the the permanent lock has in place for retention holds. So retrieval fee, we're only going to see those for standard IA one zone, IA, glacier instant flexible, all those archival tiers there. For first byte latency, express one zone is single digits, everything else is milliseconds, even glacier instant. And then these ones obviously vary based on how fast you want your data. For intelligent hearing, there's additional monitoring costs to use that, that knowledge underneath. Remember, intelligent hearing is basically doing kind of what lifecycles does, but automatically for you. And then express one zone has an additional charge request for files larger than 512 kilobytes, they want you to serve up smaller files, and they're charging you if you go for larger files. So that's the logic there. Okay.
