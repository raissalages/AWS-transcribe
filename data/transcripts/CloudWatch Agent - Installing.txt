 we keep on talking about the cloud watch agent, but how do we actually install it onto our EC two instances. So to install it, we can just use a simple systems manager, also just now called systems manager or abbreviated to SSM. And in there, they have a service called run command. And this way you can do is you press a button that says run command, and then they have these packages. And the one you're looking for is called a bus configure in this package. So what does this package do installs, or installs a distributor, a distributor package, so you can install the latest version, default version, etc, etc, packages provided by AWS, such as the cloud watch agent, and some other things are there. So this is the one that you use. It's confusing, because if you go into systems manager run command, there's actually one named cloud watch agent, but that's actually just for restarting the agent. But this one's the one that is used for installing the actual agent, okay. And so what you'll do is you'll choose it, you'll have some parameters, so you have to put install. And then in the name, you'll have to put Amazon cloud watch agent, because this package could be used to install a variety of different AWS packages. And you'll want to use the latest one. And then you need to just choose what EC two instance you want to install it on. So you can manually choose it or if it has a tag or if it's in a resource group. And one other thing I have to point out is that you must attach the cloud watch agent service server role as an IAM role to your EC two instance profile so that when the agents running, you can actually go and report back to cloud watch. Okay, so there you go. Now let's look at the anatomy of
