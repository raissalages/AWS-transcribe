 Alright, taking a look here at capacity settings, this is our way that we do manual scaling capacity settings is made up of min size, max size and desired capacity. So the min size is how many EC two instances should at least be running at a given time, the max is how many are allowed to run at max, the desired capacity is how many EC two instances you want to ideally run. And so the way we would set these values via the CLI is we just update that auto scaling group. And you can see we're setting the min and max here would work as well for that for desired capacity, we would have a separate action here for set the desired capacity. Okay. As you will always launch instances to meet the minimum size capacity. So the idea is that if you have a scenario and you just want one instance to always be running, you can set one and it will always make sure there is one running. But the point is is that there can be a point of unavailability because there's that point where the new one is spinning up. Changing the min max and desired capacity is considered manual scaling since you have to manually change these numbers to change capacity. So there you go.
