 Hey, this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro. And we are taking a look at AWS single sign on also known as AWS SSO. And so this is where you create or connect your workforce identities in AWS once and manage access centrally across your AWS organization. So the idea here is you're going to choose your identity source, whether it's AWS SSO itself, Active Directory, SAML 2.0, IdP, you're going to manage manage user permission centrally to AWS accounts, applications, SAML applications, and it uses it can you get single click access to all these things. So you know, just to kind of zoom in on this graphic here, you know, you have your on premise Active Directory, it's establishing a ad trust connection over to able to single sign on, you're going to be able to apply permissions to access resources within your AWS account. So via AWS organizations in your organizational units, down to your resources, you can also use AWS SSO to access custom SAML based applications. So you know, if I build a web app, and I like the example platform, and I wanted to use SAML based connections for single sign on there, I could do that as well. And even connect out SSO access to your business cloud application. So Office 365, Dropbox, Slack, things like that. So there you go.
