 Okay, and so we got redshift backups of backups are enabled by default, with a one day retention period. And retention periods can be modified up to 35 days. All right, redshift always attempts to maintain at least three copies of your data. One is the original copy. The second is a replica on the compute nodes. And then the third is a backup copied as three. And so redshift also can asynchronously replicate your snapshots to s3 in a different region. So you know, if you need to move your data region for region, you have that option as well.
