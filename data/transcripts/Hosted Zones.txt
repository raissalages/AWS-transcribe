 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And we are taking a look at hosted zones for refugee three. So a hosted zone is a container for record sets, scope to route traffic for a specific domain or sub domain. And there are two types of zones, we've got public hosted zones, and private hosted zones. The key difference is that public hosted zone is for traffic inbound from the internet, whereas private hosted zones is traffic within an Amazon VPC. So to configure the difference here, if you are creating a public one, it would look like this. When you use the API, you have to provide a caller reference, this is just a unique value so that when you send the send this API call, that it won't create a duplicate record, because that's something it really doesn't want to do. So here, we're using the date, we could be whatever you want, we don't have to supply a comment there. But that's just a comment to help identify what this hosted zone is for. If we are creating a hosted zone is private, we will be specifying a specific VPC and its region. And we'd be setting the hosted zone configuration to be true for private zone. So one other thing that I want to specify here, because I said up there is for domains and subdomains. But one thing that you might do, this is a more complex use case, it's something that we actually did an exam Pro for our application. But let's say you wanted to build a SAS product where each customer had their own subdomain on the apps subdomain. So the idea here is that you have this subdomain called app, and that everyone's going to get their own one. So you know, whoever it is, that they can choose whatever the name they want to be, it's going to, when it routes to that it will the app will know to be scoped for that particular customer, customers domain, or tenant. So here is some cloud formation code. And we'll just walk through this really quickly. So the first thing is you'd have to create a hosted zone. So here, we have a hosted zone on the primary domain. And then what we need is we need to create a record set to the subdomain pointing to the name server of the subdomain. So what we're talking about here is this record set here, I noticed that this record set belongs to the main hosted zone. And it's using app here. And it's asking for name servers. And then it's point it's referencing the name servers from the other subdomain hosted zone. Okay. So then we have this other hosted hosted zone that we created. And this one in particular is for app as opposed to the one up here that does not have it. And then what we'll do is we'll create a record set within the sub domain hosted zone. And we'll put a wildcard on it here with an a, an a record. And then all it's going to do is anything that's captured in this wildcard is going to go back to this domain. But the idea is that we will know the original address so that we can determine what tenant or specific customer we're referencing. So this is a real real example. And I think this is a very common example if you are building SAS applications, but just to kind of distinguish that you when you have a host zone, it can be for a domain or a sub domain. Okay.
