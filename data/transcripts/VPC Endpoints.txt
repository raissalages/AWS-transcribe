 VPC endpoints allow you to privately connect your VPC to other AWS services as well as third party services. Think of a secret tunnel where you don't have to leave the AWS network. And so this is kind of the diagram here, I'm gonna get my, I guess my laser pointer out for this. But imagine you have your EC two instance. And normally, if it wants to talk to s3, it would go over the internet. So it would leave the network, and then make its way over to s3. But with a VPC endpoint, instead, it stays within the network. And that way, it doesn't have to traverse the internet, which provides a lot of benefit, which we'll talk about here in the moment. So the benefits are eliminates the need for an internet gateway, a NAT device, a VPN connection, it was direct connect instances in the VPC do not require a public IP for address, public one still needs an IP for address, traffic between your VPC and other services do not leave the AWS network, horizontally scaled, redundant and highly available for VPC components, allow secure communication between instances and services without adding availability, risk or bandwidth constraints to your traffic. So there's that there are three variants of VPC, or three types of VPC endpoints, we have interface endpoints, gateway endpoints, and we have our gateway load balancer endpoints. I put IPv4 here, does it support IPv6? I don't know. But you know, I don't think it's gonna show up on the exam. So just understand what VPC endpoints do. Okay.
