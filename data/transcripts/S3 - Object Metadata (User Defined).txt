 look at user defined data, this is metadata set by the user. And it can be whatever you want it to be. And the only thing that matters is that when you name the key of your metadata, it has to start with x hyphen, amz hyphen, meta hyphen. So let's look at some examples. So what you could do is set it for access and security. So we have encryption access level expiration date, we have the media file, so camera model photo taken on location, we have custom application, I ran out of space there. So I just didn't put in the this here, we'll just assume that it is there. But we have app version data imported source, projects specific. So we get project ID department reviewed by documented versioning. So what is the version of this file? When was the last modified? What was the original upload date? content related. So again, shortening this because I'm running out of space, but title, author description, maybe you have this for compliance and legal. So is it on a legal hold? Does it have a compliance category retention period, backup and archival, so maybe backup status, archive date, recovery point, whatever makes sense for you to set for your user defined metadata. But there you go.
