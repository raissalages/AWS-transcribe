 A deployment package is the package which contains your function code that lambda will deploy. lambda supports two types of deployments, we have zips, which are archives, images, which are Docker containers. Let's talk about zip archives, you zip the contents of your code, and additional programming libraries, it will upload the contents to an AWS managed s3 bucket, or you upload it to an s3 bucket and reference the object address to the lambda, the zips larger than 50 megabytes have to be uploaded to an s3 bucket. First, you rely on lambda runtimes that are limited to these runtime environments. Let's talk about containers. So you build a container, you need to create a Docker file, you need to build the image, you need to push it to a repo such as ECR, it doesn't have to be ECR. But that's generally where it's going to go, you reference the container image. For the lambda, let's take a look at the implementation. Here's some Sam code, it's just cloud formation with the Sam templates. And here we're specifying the package type is zip. Notice that we also have to specify where the code is located. So this could be an s3, or it could be zipped locally. I don't know why I didn't highlight this in red. But what's really important here is the fact that we have to specify runtime, because when you zip code, you provide a runtime. Let's take a look at container being defined. So here, we're defining the Docker file. I don't think you always have to do this. So this is just how I like to do it. But you could just say, hey, it exists at this repo and go pull it. But generally, the workflow here is that we have a Docker image locally, it builds, it gets pushed to ECR or whatever repo you want. And that gets deployed. Notice we're specifying the package type is image, we do not specify the runtime because the container is the runtime between these two workflows. Working with runtimes and lambdas are super fast. So that's really nice. When you're working with containers, it's slower to build the images and push them, but you get more flexibility. So it's really up to you. What works for you. Most of the times I just work with containers because once you have it configured, it's just super easy to work with. But there you go.
