 AWS Glue data crawler is a tool that is used to analyze a targeted data source to determine its schema and generate out the AWS Glue data tables. This is a really useful tool that I like to utilize quite a bit when I'm using AWS Glue data sources that data crawler can be connected to. So we have Amazon S3. It can use the Java database connectivity tool, also known as JDBC, to connect to a variety of different types of databases that support JDBC. We have DynamoDB, a MongoDB client to connect to a variety of different MongoDB sources or compatible sources. Delta Lake, so if you're running Delta Lake, you could utilize that. Apache iceberg tables stored in S3. Hootie tables stored in S3. And for this tool, you can run it on a schedule, or you can run it on demand. I don't really have much to say about this, because this is a very straightforward service, but you'll end up seeing us utilize it as we use AWS Glue. Okay.
