 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And we are going to cover what is a gateway because there is a lot of things called gateways in AWS. And so I figured it would be very important to kind of glue this knowledge all together before we jump into all the types of gateways. So what is a gateway a gateway in the context of cloud services is a networking service which sits between two different networks. It's a gateway, imagine a door opening and closing, right? It's a gate. So gateways often act as reverse proxies, firewalls, or load balancers. And so if you see a load balancer, it is a gateway, and vice versa. So just understand that these terms are interchangeable. Let's go over all the types of gateways that I could find on a bus, there's probably more, but some are very specific networking components for VPC. Some are gateways in name in terms of service, but they technically are gateways. And in general, and other things are gateways for very specific services, but are not part of VPC. So let's cover them. The first is internet gateway, also known as IGW. This is for inbound and outbound public traffic for IPv4 and IPv6. So it's a pretty good one. And you'll be definitely using this. There's egress only internet gateway. This is for outbound private traffic for IPv6. The reason why we need this is because the only way we can have a private subnet ensure that it doesn't have public internet is is to use this method because IPv6 addresses by default are public. So the only way to prevent them is basically to block public access in this special way with this, this egress only internet gateway. We have carrier gateway. This is for connecting to AWS partner telecom networks. This is specifically for AWS wavelength. We have NAT gateways. These are outbound private traffic for IPv4. Because IPv4 not all addresses are known, you have to do some kind of translation and map them so that they can internally route to private networks. It's the only way that it can work. There are other NAT stuff in a bus. So before NAT gateways, there were NAT instances. And there are nets that you can launch up from the the end of a store. So there are a few options there. We have virtual private gateway, this is the endpoint into an AWS account from a VPN connection. So this is for private secure connections, or we say secure private connections, but not necessarily secure. You need another layer for that we have customer gateway, this is the endpoint into your on premise account for a VPN connection. So when you're doing VPNs, or other things, you're gonna often use a customer gateway, you'll use it probably for more than one thing, but you have customer gateway and virtual private gateway, go hand in hand, they're used together quite often, we have gateway load balancer g w lb, I've never used this, but I understand what it is. It is a layer three network layer load balancer to run and scale third party virtual applications, such as firewalls, or IDs and IPS. If you've heard of guard duty, for a bus, imagine you wanted to use a third party one that had more controls, this is what you'd have to use, so that anything that's going to reach your EC two instances are going to pass through this very particular product that you prefer to use. And I'm going to assume that there's a marketplace for them. Or maybe there's a way to hook up custom ones. If we do actually look at this more detail, we'll we'll know when we get to that point, we have direct connect gateway, this is an endpoint connection to a fiber optic connection to a co location data center, we have a backup gateway, this is a very specific gateway for the database backup service, you have IoT device gateway, this is a very specific gateway to IoT data for the IoT services for AWS, you have it was transit gateway, this is a very broad service that gives you a hub and spoke model to, to, I say simply here, but it should be to simplify to simplify VPC peering, it's an alternate way of doing VPC peering that is much easier if you have a lot of VPCs, you have Amazon API gateway, this abstracts API endpoints, the services we have a storage gateway, this is syncing, caching, or extending local storage to cloud storage. So this is a particular service and it has products underneath, but they're all gateways. Some cloud services call their gateways load balancers and vice versa. So they're technically all gateways. The difference between load balancers and gateways can can also mean the direction. So one is a reverse proxy, right? The other one's not. But you know, just understand broadly what gateways are they gatekeep data at or like the flow of traffic between two networks. Okay, so there you go.
