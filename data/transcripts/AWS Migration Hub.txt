 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And we're taking a look at AWS migration hub. This is a single place to discover your existing servers, plans, migrations and track the status of each application migration. The migration hub can monitor migration status for migration services such as application migration service, and database migration service. It has a few tools that you can utilize to aid you in the migration, you actually have to use at least one of these, which is the database discovery agent. So that's an agent installed in the VM with servers to help discover and migrate servers that you have the migration evaluator collector, this is really just a form you submit to the bus. And that they're trying to get their business teams involved to convince you to migrate over to AWS, there's some sub services in here. So we have the AWS migration hub refactor. So this bridges the networking across AWS accounts so that a legacy and new services can communicate while they maintain the independence of separate accounts. They have AWS migration hub journey, these are guided templates for end to end migrations. So there's a lot going on in this service that I'm not talking about here. But I don't feel like we need to get into the weeds of this one, as it doesn't appear much on the exam, what you need to know is that there's a bunch of stuff in here. And we'll explore that in the lab. So you have an idea of what you can do here. But these aren't things that we could practically execute in labs just because they're very complex. Migration always is a very complex thing that these aren't easy to stage. But just generally understand what migration hub is okay.
