 A gateway endpoint provides reliable connectivity to Amazon s3 and DynamoDB without requiring the internet gateway, or a nap device for your VPC. I've seen these called VPC gateway endpoints. I've seen these called gateway VPC endpoints and also just gateway endpoints. And they have nothing to do with gateway load balancer endpoints. They're their own thing. Very straightforward, you can use them, they can connect you to DynamoDB or s3, just those two services. They do not use private link, they have no additional charge, and they only work for DynamoDB and s3. So they're very cost effective because free way of keeping a secure connection for those particular services. To create a gateway endpoint, you must specify the VPC in which you want to create the endpoint and the service to which you want to establish They're super straightforward. But there you go.
