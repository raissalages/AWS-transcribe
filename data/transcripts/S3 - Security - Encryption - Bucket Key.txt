 Let's talk about s3 bucket key. I mentioned it prior, we're talking about SSE hyphen, s3, and SSE hyphen kms. This is a security feature has nothing to do with object keys, it just they both happen to have the word key in the name. So when you use SSE kms, an individual data key is used on every object request. And so in this case, s3 is going to have to call a bus kms every time to get that key kms charges on the number of requests. So this charge can add up at volume might not be an issue for everybody, but definitely can be an issue at scale. So the s3 bucket key lets you generate a short lived bucket level key for native key that is temporarily stored in s3. This will reduce the request caused by up to 99%. This will decrease the request traffic improve overall performance. What confuses me about s3 bucket keys is that you can apply them both to SSE hyphen kms and SSE hyphen s3 and SSE hyphen s3 is free to use. So you're not going to get any cost saving with SSE hyphen s3. But maybe you get an improved performance because if SSE hyphen s3 is using kms underneath, maybe they have like a managed globally key for everybody, I don't know. But I guess the only advantage of using with SSE hyphen s3 is to reduce or improve traffic performance overall. But the way it's going to work is when we apply encryption at the bucket level, which is something we can do, you saw that we were applying at the object level, but you can just say globally, hey, I want to always use with this. The default encryption to use this kms key, we can specify bucket key enabled. So always use a bucket key. So a few other things, a unique bucket level key is generated for each requester. So it's not going to be for the entire bucket for everything, but it will be for the entire bucket per requester. So unique requester, you can enable bucket key at the bucket level to apply all new objects. That's what we are showing in that example in the S3 API, you can enable bucket key at the object level for only specific objects, I didn't show that because we show a lot of object specific stuff. And a lot of other slides, S3 bucket key can be enabled for s3, SSCS s3, SSCS, and again, this makes more sense for SSCS. If it's a cost reason, if it's just a performance reason, then maybe SSCS three can benefit from this. Okay.
