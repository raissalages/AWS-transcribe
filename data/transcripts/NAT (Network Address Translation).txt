 Before we talk about NAT gateways and NAT instances, we need to know what network address translation is. So it is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying the network address information in the IP header of packets while they're in transit across a traffic routing device. So an example for a bus would be imagine you have an EC two instance that's using ipv4, it has an internal address, something like 1010 10 to 54. But that's a address that makes sense in a local network, but out to the internet, that makes no sense. So you have to map it to an address that can be readable back to that private instance. And so here, you can see that it's going to be 172 16, 131 to 54. And so that's what the NAT is doing. It's it is mapping those internal IPs, those private IPs to public IPs. There's another use for NAT. And that's when you have two private networks, and they happen to have the same IP address where you'd have conflicts, because of course, there'd be no way to route to both of them. So the the NAT would be able to resolve the differences between that and give them different IP addresses. So hopefully, that is very clear what network address translation is. Nats really makes sense for ipv4. ipv6 is not an issue because you have an inexhaustible list of addresses. Okay.
