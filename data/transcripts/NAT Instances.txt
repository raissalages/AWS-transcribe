 So a NAT instance is an AWS managed I am to launch a NAT onto an individual EC two instance. And so this was what existed before NAT gateways. And they worked fine. The only thing was that they didn't have any built in scaling. So whereas NAT gateways will automatically increase or decrease the amount of compute underneath to handle the workload or the throughput NAT instances, you are actually having to manage the EC two instances. And that could cause disruptions and it requires a lot more additional maintenance, but it was very cost effective. So this was still seen as a cost effective alternative to NAT gateway. And I mean, that's the diagram very straightforward here, you can deploy your problem, I guess you could deploy your private subnet if you wanted as well, but there it is in the public subnet. And, you know, people are still using this even though NAT gateway existed because of cost. However, it stopped supporting their NAT ami. And they said they're they're going to stop development in 2018. And it's it's reached the end of support in 2023. So there's really no reason to use this anymore. Luckily, via the marketplace, it was marketplace, you can get community ami's or even probably paid ami's like managed ami's for third party NAT software. So if you're looking for an alternative to NAT gateway, that could be more cost effective or more feature rich, then, you know, look into the marketplace. So there you go.
