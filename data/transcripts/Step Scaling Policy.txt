 So step scaling policies change capacity in either direction by a certain amount at a different threshold, which we call steps when a cloud watch alarm is repeatedly triggered. So the idea here is that we have something that looks very similar, but I'm just gonna get my pen tool out here. Now we have it set as a step scaling policy. Okay, this adjustment type here says percentage and change capacity, right. But the idea here is that we're going to set steps. And so each of these is a step. So we're saying we're setting a lower bound and an upper bound. And then we say how much to adjust the scaling. So here, between zero and 15, it's going to adjust the scaling by 10. From 15 to 25 is going to adjust it by 20. And then if it goes, it says lower bound 25. And I guess anything above that is going to be 30. And then it tells you the minimum magnitude of the adjustment. So hopefully that is pretty clear. Again, we see what it looks like to create a cloud watch alarm. So we don't have to show that here on the screen. So it's just not being shown there but pretty similar to simple scaling but with steps.
