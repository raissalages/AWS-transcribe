 destinations and destinations are producers, they just call them sources and destinations for firehose. But they can send to specific AWS services, third party services or HTTP endpoints. So for AWS services, you got s3 redshift, open search. Okay. Which is interesting, because earlier I wrote elastic search. Yeah, I guess elastic search is there. But I'm not sure why it's not listed here. So there might be some discrepancies or something has changed. That's weird. Sometimes every the docs, sometimes they use it. And there's just different things there, and you have to roll it up. But the point is, we have s3 redshift, open search, and possibly elastic search, even though I have it listed there. For custom destinations, you can have an HTTP endpoint. So that is pretty useful. And then third party destinations, we have a lot of stuff listed here. But I think what's pretty much universally used here is Splunk. So if you're going to learn a third party destination, Splunk would be a really good one to utilize. Each destination has different destination configuration options. Often third party apps need API key keys from the provider. And there could be a lot to configure. So just understand that
