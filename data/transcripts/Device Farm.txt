 Hey, this is Andrew Brown, let's take a look at AWS device farms. This is an application testing service to test your apps in different environments. It can do mobile device type testing. So you upload your native iOS or Android app, it can also test mobile web apps, you can utilize the built in test fuzz test suite, which will randomly test actions, that's the one we end up using in the lab videos will be captured of runs, screenshots will be captured of runs, you can choose multiple devices, it has physically owns these phones, you're actually connecting to real phones, you can also remotely connect to the phones, if you don't want to run a suite against them, you can just launch a phone up and upload your app so you can test it. And the key difference between using something like Android Studios virtual phones and these is these are actual real phones, you can test using a suite, a test suite using Appium. And Appium supports a lot of languages that it will allow you to upload. There's also desktop browsing testing. So you can test your web app against multiple web browsers, you can use Selenium to write your tests. So there you go.
