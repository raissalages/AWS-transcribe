 So now let's look at actually how to get an SDS from using with assume role with web identity. So this action here is going to return a set of temporary credentials for the users who have been authorized in a mobile or web application. So you have a developer. And the first thing you're going to do is you need to authenticate with whatever the web identity is. So we're going to send an OAuth call to Facebook, as our example here. And they're going to send us back a JavaScript web token at JWT. And then once we have that, what we can do is use something like the CLI, you could also use the AWS SDK, but we'll use the CLI. And we're going to call the assume role with web identity, passing along that JWT. And then the STS service is going to determine whether it's going to give us a token or not. And so there it passes along the temporary credentials. So we're going to get that information. So now that we have those temporary credentials, we can use the CLI or other means to gain access to a variety of AWS services within our AWS account, and just whatever we decide that they're allowed to gain access to. So that is the process for getting an STS for at least the assume role with web identity. What's really important to note is the order that this happens in because this definitely shows up on the exam. They'll ask you like they'll give you an example of the order of when this happens and just know that you always authenticate with the web identity first and then you get the token second from STS. So just remember that it's always the web identity first and you'll definitely score points on the exam.
