 geo proximity routing policies allow you to direct traffic based on the geographic location of your users and your AWS resources. You can route more or less traffic to a specific resource by specifying a bias value, bias values, expand or shrink the size of the geographic region for which traffic is rather to you must use a revenue three traffic flow to use proximity routing policies, which is why you're not going to see me showing you CLI commands, API commands here. So how does it work? Well, this is the standard bias that you would see in the traffic flow. And you can adjust it. So if you said plus 25 in US East, then it will grow. Or if you reduce it, then it will shrink. In revenue three traffic flow, you can select any region and visualize the biased. So you select one and you can see there's a lot to choose from. And here, here's an example if you had all the regions selected, because you select which regions you want to have bias list. And here is if it was custom. So we are skipping a very particular coordinate. Like I think I think I want to say Hawaii, but I'm not 100% certain if that's a lie, but I think I was trying to go for Hawaii there. But there you go.
