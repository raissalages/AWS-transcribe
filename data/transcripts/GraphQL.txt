 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And let's talk about graph qL. So graph qL is an open source agnostic query adapter that allows you to query data from many different data sources. And graph qL is used to build API's where clients will send a query for nested data. The primary reason to use graph qL, at least the way I understand it is that it's going to mitigate issues of versioned API's, or rapidly changing API's compared to REST API's, because you can request exactly the data you want, because the client is saying, here's a query, give me this data back. Okay, so graph qL schemas are written in the graph qL scl schema definition language, which is composed of types, fields, queries, mutations, subscriptions. There's a lot more to this. But I'm just keeping it really simple here, because I'm not here to teach you the depths of graph qL, just the basics. So you have types which represent objects, and they have their fields. We have queries, which define the exact shape of the data you want back from the client, you have mutations, which allow you to do creations, updates, or deletes. And you have subscriptions, which support live updates sent from the server to the client. So there you go.
