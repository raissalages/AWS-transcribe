 service token service, also known as STS is a web service that enables you to request temporary limited privilege credentials for IAM users or federated users. So the STS is a global service and all STS requests go to a single endpoint at sts.amazon, AWS calm, you can use the following API actions to obtain STS. So there is a bunch of I am API actions, the most common being assumed role and assume role with web identity. When you look at trying to do cross account roles, you're going to become extremely familiar with a assume role. When you make a call to STS, it's going to return back generally this information. So it's gonna give you back a temporary access key, secret access key, and its session token and its expiration. So I just want to point out that STS is not hard. But it's definitely something you will want to remember, because it is used quite often for a lot of scenarios. So I just want to show you exactly how you would use STS. So here's an example in Python, the idea is that we are calling the STS client. And then from here, we're going to assume a role, which is one of the API actions that we can utilize. And then here, it's going to return back the credentials. And then we can just load the credentials back into the client. And now any calls with the Bodo three, the AWS Python SDK is going to use those temporary credentials. We also can use the CLI, it's actually easier to use it with the CLI, as we can just assume the role pass the role aren that we want to assume, get back credentials, and then load those into our environment variables or our CLI configuration file credentials file in order to do that. So it is a lot more secure to use use STS as opposed to using your long live credentials. So there is a strategy where you could have a user, and the user just assumes roles as permissions to assume roles, but does not have permissions inherently to themselves. And these short lived credentials are going to expire after a certain amount of time, you're going to run into less issues there. So there you go. Okay.
