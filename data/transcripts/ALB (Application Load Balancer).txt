 Alright, let's take a look here at ALB. And by the way, if you're seeing graphics where sometimes the icon is purple, or sometimes it's orange, just know that it was changed the color on me. And I'm not going to go and just fix every diagram every time it was decides to change the color. So there will be color discrepancies throughout the section. But anyway, ALB is designed to balance HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It operates on the layer seven of the OSI model. It has features called request routing, those are those advanced routes we talked about, which allows you to add routing rules to your listeners based on HTTPS protocols, supports web sockets, HTTP two for real time bi directional communication apps, it can handle authorization authentication of HTTP requests, which usually will happen via a custom lambda can only be accessed via a hostname. If you need a static IP, forward it you can forward it to an LB to then ALB. So that that's key thing, you don't get a sag IP with it. We have laughs that you can place in front of them. This gives you the O was protection O was is a a type of suite of O was is an open source project for security and they have O was top 10, which is what this covering guests which covers against common threats via HTTPS, you can use ACM to attach a certificate which would give you a custom domain and SSL for that custom domain. You can use global accelerator in front of it to improve global availability. You can put cloud front in front in front of it to improve global caching for common HTTP requests usually read only requests. You can use Amazon Cognito to use authentication for HTTP requests probably through lambda. Use cases here are microservices and containerized apps, e commerce, retail websites, corporate websites and web apps, SaaS apps, very good load balancer, you'll definitely be utilizing this one. Okay.
