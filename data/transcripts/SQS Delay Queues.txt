 Let's take a look here at delay queues. So delay queues lets you postpone the delivery of new messages to consumers for a number of seconds when your app needs more time. So any message that you send to a delay queue, remain invisible to consumers for the duration of that delay period. The default is zero seconds, the max value is 15 minutes, standard queues. For them, it will be per queue delay setting will only apply on new messages for FIFO will apply to all messages in the queue. You can set the delay seconds just similar to the visibility timeout by setting it on the attributes. A message is hidden when it's first added to the queue.
