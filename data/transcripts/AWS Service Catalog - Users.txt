 talk about the types of users in the service catalog, which we saw in the anatomy there a moment ago. And there's two types of service catalog users, we have catalog administrators, and end users. So catalog administrators manage a catalog of products, organizing them into portfolios and granting access to the end users. An administrator is technically responsible for preparing the cloud formation templates, configuring constraints, managing IAM roles assigned to products, and the end user uses the management console to launch products that admins have granted the access to the end user. So there you go.
