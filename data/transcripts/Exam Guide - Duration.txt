 let me just go check one moment. I just want to make sure that's still true. Yep. So I thought that looked a bit odd. And actually, they give you more time now. So now it's 2.1 hours and you get taking my pen out here. Two minutes per question. So the exam time is 100 130 minutes. And the seat time is 160 minutes, we always just add 30 minutes for seat time. See time refers to the amount of time that you should allocate for the exam, because they tell you to check in 30 minutes early or even an hour earlier early. It includes time to review instructions, show online proctor your workspace, read and accept the NDA complete the exam, provide feedback at the end. These certifications should be valid for 36 months for three years before recertification. I did not see any change. So this seems like this is the same. So yeah, that's pretty clear there. And I just want to have some real talk with you about certifications and goals just because the certifications are very different from 2016. It's almost like 10 years ago. And I just want to make it clear how they fit in your, your work goals or your career goals, just so that you're getting realistic advice here. But the aid of a solution architect will not make you a solutions architect. And a lot of people think that that they get the cert now that you can apply for essay roles, and it's not going to happen. I'm going to tell you why because a solution architect is a senior role that is given to those with years of experience, we're talking like a decade or more experience and deep knowledge of implementing technical workloads. And it might be possible to get a role as an essay, but it's probably only entitled, you'd actually be working as a cloud engineer. So you will not land a solution architect role in nine months, you won't land one in three years. They're highly sought after just because of the nature of, of these roles. But that does not mean that a cloud engineer role is not a great role to have, or cloud developer role is not great to have. But you know, understand that it will take time to get to this, if you want to do that, an obtainable role would be cloud engineer or cloud developer, and you need to complement this certification with deeper implementation knowledge found in other certifications, such as the developer associate, which will teach you developer tools, deployment, applications, programming, API's, they don't teach you programming, but you have to have those skills to utilize services. This is ops administrator. So cloud networking, infrastructure, automation, servers like Linux, or Windows, things like that personal projects, like architecting and implementing complex solutions. So understand that it does not end with certifications, but certifications giving you a block knowledge of cloud knowledge without the actual base knowledge underneath. Another thing I need to point out is AWS itself does not care about it certifications for hiring for their own technical roles. So if you're thinking that you're going to go work for AWS, getting all the AWS certifications, they don't care. When you get hired at AWS, they then will encourage you to get certifications when you're there, but not but not as a prerequisite to try to get hired. certification survey structured way of learning with a goalpost. So that is the purpose of certifications. And if companies outside of Amazon partner networks, or AWS partner networks, or AWS, whether they care about them or not is up to those individual companies. But just understand, again, the essay is highly saturated. So you can put it on your resume, but you need to, again, round out those skills with other things. So cloud certifications expect you to already have these foundational technical skills. So you're already supposed to know programming scripting, SQL, it networking, Linux and Windows servers, at a low level project management, that could also include code management like Git and GitHub, developer tools, and not the tools that are in the cloud, but the developer tools you need to build things, application development skills, you might need comp sci algorithmic skills, systems design and more. And so where would you get this knowledge because they're not generally required. So most certification courses that aren't mine won't teach you this stuff. They'll just teach you to pass exam. So you can get this knowledge from free code camp, free code camp teaches a lot of stuff, but you will have to know what to search for. Whether it's like Java, or rust, or learning about caches, or whatever. I do want to point out that we also have an offering exam Pro, most of our stuff is free. But what we're finding is that a lot of people taking certifications have these gaps, and then they go to free code camp, and they can find information, but it's not optimized, specifically for cloud roles. And it might not have contextual information, how we work on the job. And so we have this exam Pro supporter subscription that you can pay for. And the idea is that if you're in there, then I will survey folks ask them what kind of content they want, and I'll produce it. And this is a more effective way to fill those gaps that you absolutely need. And one thing that people really want for me is like portfolio projects, and things like that. So that would be something that I would consider if people want us to create. So just consider that as well. Okay. And so there's three more things I just wanted to tell you. And this is specifically about how we're trying to help you get these real world skills in the certifications. So in our hands on instructions, we will do our best to try and fill these gaps. But I can't make all the content have all that information, because they're basically like entire courses. So I'm basically speed running you through those components, but I don't skip them. So other courses, what they'll do is they'll just have staged things. And then you stand them up, but you have no idea how you'd even build that stuff. But I actually go through and do that. So there's like a video where we literally build an app before we, we go and deploy it. And so you'll find that sometimes we'll be spending considerable amount of time coding or doing something prior to using the service. So it might feel like the video is 75%, not the cloud service, and then 25%, or 10% is, but that's what's important. And that's what I'm finding that people need. So just understand that our labs are long. And, and they're not heavily edited, because I do not want to leave things out. And if I run into problems, I want to show you the troubleshooting. That's the part that you should want to watch. Okay. Some hands on labs might end in failed implementations, but are left in to experience the troubleshooting or the accurate reflection of what it's like to work with a specific cloud services. Just because it's on the exam, and you have to learn it doesn't mean that you would actually want to use that service in production or for a company. And it does ship a lot of services, as like an MVP, and they never get any better. And so you know, if I'm having frustration with the service, and I've been using AWS for over a decade, and have been multiple decades working, you know, in this field, then you should take my advice there and understand that you might not be worth your time to utilize it. But the other thing is that, you know, again, it's like the troubleshooting and and debugging and trying to work through stuff is what you should want to obtain, because it gives you real insight, and allows you to, you know, solve things on your own. Okay, we try and do our best to clean up costly infrastructure. But you should always be proactive and check if resources are left running. We made the end of this cloud practitioner course. And we showed you all the pricing stuff and how to avoid pricing. If you didn't do that course first, do that one, don't skip it. And specifically don't skip mine, because in mine, I go always beyond the requirements of the certifications to give you that real world knowledge, they want you to be job ready, or I want you to be able to apply it right away. And even in this one, I'm shooting labs, sometimes in other videos, I'll be like, Oh, I forgot to clean this up might be necessary bucket that doesn't have any spend. But my point is, is that you need to be responsible and, and be very diligent about checking your costs and spend every day. Okay, so, you know, be aware of that. But yeah, that's about it. And we'll go take a look at the exam guide. Okay. Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And this video, I want to take a look at the exam guide. But before we do, I just want to tell you something I feel that is happening with a number of certifications. So they used to be the best certifications out there. They're just like so well written the questions the the composition of exams. But in the last few years, they've really lost quality in a lot of areas. I think it might have been because it was post COVID. And they let people go. And then there was a lot of internal pressure, the industry and certifications to meet metrics, whatever those metrics were. And so we started seeing really strange behavior where we had a lot of employees that were pushing only AWS internal content. And then just like, AWS employees on the socials, saying, like over promising what these certifications could do for you because they wanted to drive metrics. So they're basically telling you like, and I'm not lying, I'm not making this up. But they'd be like, yeah, you can get a solutions architect role in nine months, if you commit yourself to the certifications. And then they would point to their internal platform, which just did not have all the information that you need to actually get a role. And I think it was even recently announced that it of us, like from the time of this video that, you know, they they had to lay off a lot of people in this department, and that they were going to work with third party, third party providers to help deliver training, not me, even though they know me, but not me, because I make a stink at them all the time to tell make their stuff better. But you know, it's really unfortunate. Now, that doesn't mean that it was certifications are not worth your time. They still are, they're still good. But I would just say that we have to make sure that we do not drink the Kool Aid, and buy into the marketing and understand that there are other things behind here that are in effect. And it might not be for your benefit to listen to these folks. But they do have additional materials. They have some games and stuff like that. But I can just tell you, it's wholly, wholly not enough to help you out, even they have like training, like hands on training, if you get to those programs with essays. And the big problem with that is that AWS has a solution architect role that is specific data bus, and it doesn't look like any other essay role out there. And the problem is, is that if you want to work at AWS, you can't even, you can't even get a job getting the essay certification. So I don't know, I just, I just want to warn you about that. I don't want you to, you know, waste a lot of your time and effort. Because some people end up running out of money, and they go full on in and I just want to caution you to pace yourself in your journey and and protect yourself. Okay. So let's go down here and take a look at the exam guide. So if we're going to go ahead and download exam guide here, and what's nice is they do also have some practice exam questions. So we'll open that as well. Maybe look at the practice exam questions first, so we can see them. And look how wordy they are. And a lot of them are like this. When I saw the exam, I noticed that the question quality like there was a very strict structure that they follow has kind of waned and it's become a little bit less well worded. But generally, it'll follow this pattern like the company runs a public facing three tier web app in a VPC across multiple azs, etc, etc. And so the idea is that when when I was saying earlier in the exam guide that you have to get past the word verbiage or word garbage, you have to look at this and say, Okay, I see a three tier public app, VPC, az, etc. Like, I literally don't see the whole sentence, I just see keywords. And then I piece the architecture in my head. And then I just read the last line of what they're asking. And then I choose it. But I would say that, at least when I sat this exam last and what other people saw was like, I wasn't seeing a lot like this, these kind of questions. So you know, on our platform, we I wrote more ones that I felt reflected the current exam, these are still good as a as a way to practice. So definitely utilize these and test your knowledge here. But make sure you do some studying before you go ahead and look at those. Okay. But here's the exam guide. And we'll open it up. And I do not need an AI assistant. They're always over here bugging me these AI folks. But notice it says that the target candidate should have at least one year hands on experience designing cloud solutions that use AWS. You can I guess. I mean, if you did this, the cloud practitioner, and you want to go straight into this exam, you absolutely can. So I don't think you need to wait a year to do this. But obviously, it can help you if you do that. We see our multiple choice or multiple response. So that looks very clear. Notice that or I should say, consider that when AWS writes exam questions, like multiple choice, there's usually a pattern called horse, zebra elephant. And so imagine you had four questions, there's always an obvious answer, which is the horse, then there's one that could be correct, which we call the zebra, but it's not, it's too exotic of an answer. And then there's two elephants, which ones are very obviously wrong. And so I would say that traditionally, the associates have kind of followed that pattern, I'd say that it's harder now. So it's not as obvious as it was before. But you know, understand that as a pattern that is kind of implored. Down below here, it says exam includes 50 questions affect your score, and there are 15 unscored. And then they talk about exam results and the scaled scoring and stuff like that. So let's go down here and take a look at our domains are first being designed secure architectures. There says access and management across multiple accounts. I didn't see much multi account stuff. I think they're probably just talking about organizations because you can create multiple accounts. But there wasn't much multi account knowledge in the certification, which I was a bit disappointed on. But it would definitely be in the pro. So getting it here would be good. We have federated access and identity services. Yep, single sign on, I definitely got on my exam, global infrastructure, we cover that in the competition, but they don't really like you don't need to, like it's just implicitly known from the competition. So it's not like there's anything new to know from that exam. So if you did the competition, or you have that Emma security best practices, principal, least privilege stuff, again, shared responsibility model, this is cloud petitioner knowledge, they're not asking you, like, what is the shared responsibility model? Or what is principal least privilege, that's the competition. This is just general stuff you're supposed to know. And then we have skills here. So working with I am multi factor authentication, the token service, service control policies, like I never had any questions, service control policies, they're not that hard to figure out. I'm roles, one thing I know, so they had more directory service stuff. So I, I've said in the past that it has always lacked in directory services, I guess, trying to make up for that, competing with Azure. And so we're seeing more than focusing on their directory service offering. So we need to know a little bit about active directory, and service directory architecture in our in the certification. Then we have design secure workloads and applications here. So now there's some endpoints, cognito, guard duty, Macy, and this is all high level stuff. I do labs and show you for the most part, all these things. But again, you just basically have to note the services are DDoS SQL injection, this is stuff that we cover in the cloud petitioner. So it's not really, I wouldn't probably put it in this course, designing VPC architecture with security components. So we definitely thoroughly do everything with VPC. And it's something that is required for all of our associates, professionals and everything. So anything that touches VPC will thoroughly know. So it looks fine there. There wasn't a lot of hybrid stuff. So a bus direct connect would be something for a hybrid architecture, but we do have to talk about it, but not necessarily know how to do it. Because you don't have a data center, I don't have a data center. So that's kind of hard to teach in a lab. We have data security controls. So kms ACM. Yep, all those things are good. Now we're in domain two, so design resilient architectures, we are seeing a lot of developer related services, API gateway, REST API, SQS, secrets manager, this is all stuff that you would learn hands on in the developer. So I will have labs, even in the solution architects, I'm basically preparing you for those other certifications. And then in those ones, in particular, I might add more labs to just make the knowledge deeper for those specific services. But for the real exam, you just have to conceptually know about them. But do the labs because they will cement that knowledge. ALBs Yep, so load balancing, things like that. Kubernetes doesn't really come up much in the exam. So don't stress yourself about Kubernetes. And it is a big pain to utilize. It's the hardest managed Kubernetes service out of all the cloud service providers out there. And I think I did the lab and it just like, it took like two hours and it failed. And so I just brought my older video was fine. But I just brought it over for the case DNA, just because it was so painful. So like, again, you know, for that for those harder ones, you just watch Kubernetes, you don't have to do it. Because Kubernetes and cognitive its own thing, there's like a whole certification for that. So they talk about multi tier architectures, they're always just talking about the three tier, nothing complicated microservice kind of the kind of wants you to know about that achieve loose coupling based on requirements, we talked about decoupling in the competition, or you should do that one. When to use containers, service technologies and patterns. Yeah, yeah. And then we have availability, fault tolerance architectures. I honestly didn't get a whole lot of this, we cover a good chunk of this in the competitioner. And we obviously have it here in the shark tech as well. But I would say that this part, which is very important is not that presence, just kind of like, again, things you implicitly should know. So I would say that was my experience. We have high performing architecture. So now there's some like storage, and talk about high performance storage always factors in more questions on I think I had, I don't see it here, but definitely I saw NFS or NFS, FSX, which is a service that allows you to deploy different file storage types. Okay, but yeah, the point is, it just goes on and on and on, and you have databases, you have to know a little bit of everything. Okay, so like, we can scroll here forever. And here's the problem with it was exams is that, and now we get to this section where it lists all of the possible services. And as I scroll through them here, this is like, what could get covered? And these are all the services to get covered? Do they all appear on the exam? No. And yeah, the sub scope, but could they? Absolutely, yes. And that's the hard part. So like, as a content creator, I want to give you a complete course. And even if they don't appear on the exam and are unlikely to I have to cover it. Because if other courses are covering it, even though they don't really matter, then I have to cover it. Otherwise, people look at the marketing page and go, well, Andrew didn't do, you know, x service, but this person did why so there's is more complete even though it's on the exam. And this is a failing of AWS's ability to produce an exam guide that is realistic. And it was his approach to their exams is that you are expected, like the exam is, it's not one to one, I'll give you an example. So if we go over to hashicorp terraform certification, okay, see if I can find the certification here. certification, I forgot to type that word in here. So if you go to this one, and their exam guide, there's a sure many questions there are. But the point is, is that for every point, every topic that they cover, there's exactly one question at least on the exam. Okay, so if you do all of this, like go all the way down the list, and you study 20, you learn it, then you are well prepared for the hashicorp exam, which I think is a good way I like that now. The way it works is they say, here's all this content, and you might only see one third of this stuff on your exam. So you basically have to study, study, study, study, and just hope that you don't get one on it was firewall manager. And this just has to do again, with the way that AWS architectures their exams. But we end up over studying and learning more stuff than we actually need to. And that's just the nature of it. So just don't worry about it too much. And the way I have to approach it, I'll just show you here, like this is my big refresh. And actually went through here, and I mapped all the stuff out. And I said, Okay, you know, like, for instance, like formation, I didn't get any exams on like formation, I see other content creators being like formation, their exams, and I go, should I put this in here, it's not really a huge focus, it is a point on here, should I put two slides in it. And that's the hard call, right. And this is also a very hard service to do a lab on. So, you know, just understand, like, I'm doing an extreme detail and trying to get you excellent coverage the best I can. And this might be the most overdone course. But the point is, is that I just want to again, make sure you have good coverage. Okay. So you know, hopefully that gives you better confidence in terms of the materials here. And, you know, just understand the nature of the exams and the nature of the exams. But I'll see you in the next one. Okay, ciao.
