 it's Andrew Brown. And we are taking a look at Amazon Lex, technically version two, which is a conversation net interface service. With Lex, you can build conversational voice and text chat box, if you've ever heard of Alexa, this is the enterprise, your commercial version of that, that is on AWS. So you can imagine that you can have a conversation with a bot, it will reply. Version two provides natural language understanding automatic speak recognition, it provides multiple bot templates for common industries as a starting point, provides transit transcripts to create a new bot uses Gen AI to build a bot by describing what it is that you want, which I thought was very interesting. Choose a target language, you can choose from multiple AWS provided voices, if you're using the voice feature, whether it's a voice bot or chat bot integrates with AWS lambda to connect to other various AWS services they want you to know with these ml AI services is management, they all can connect to lambda. That's how you integrate them with other services. And you'll use application integration services like step functions, kinesis, data firehose, SQL, SNS, things like that. There is a thing called Amazon Lex network of bots, which is something newer, they notice it is a feature of Lex that adds multiple bots to a single network, a network can intelligently route the query to the appropriate bot. This provides a unified experience for customers and reduces duplication of intent configuration. For multiple specialized bots. Let's look at the components here so that when we go take a look at Lex, we understand what we are utilizing here. So we have the bot itself, this performs the automated task. Obviously, this is what you're going to interact with. A bot has a version, which are snapshots of your bot model, you can have an alias, which will point to a specific version. So you can be like production, and it's pointed to version 10. Right? You have to specify the language or languages that the bot can utilize, because they can target more than one language, you have your intents, which represent your actions you want to perform sample utterances, which are example text on what the intent would look like when being something being uttered. So here it is talking about ordering a pizza. So we have some variants there as utterances, you have slots, these are inputs that an intent will require of the user, this can be zero, if you don't have any specific inputs, you have to specify the slot type, which are often new numeration values like small, medium, large. But a bus does have some built in like Amazon dot number if you need like numeric stuff like that. So there you go.
