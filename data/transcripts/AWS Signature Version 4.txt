 So this is the diagram that AWS gives us for its AWS signature version four, I'm just gonna tell you, I've never ever had any reason to ever do this. So I don't have the practical experience on this. But I understand what's going on, I just wanted to convey that to you. So you have a general idea of what is happening here. So the idea is that you need to first assemble a string to sign. So you're going to get the data that you want to pass along that it was going to use to verify you. I'm sure there's very specific information they want you to provide there. But the idea is you're assembling that string, then you're going to use a signing key using h Mac for the string to sign. The key thing to remember here is that it's using a secret secret access key in version two, they use maybe a combination of those I don't remember. But the idea is that you're using your secret access key in order to generate out that date key and then the date key is used in the region key and then the region key. I don't know if you see this, but it's kind of cascading where it's like here to here, here to here. And then finally, that one is used to sign the key. And then down below, you have your signing key and then your string to sign. So your string to sign is really actually all the way down here, it says step two, but it really is here in step three. And that's going to produce that final signature that you can use. Depending on the type of request, this process might vary a bit in terms of how that works. So it's based on your request type, the most common one is in authorization headers, it could also be in a post request or query parameters, they more or less look the same in terms of, like if I showed you example photos, but the one we saw in the last one was in the query parameters, or I would say query string. But yeah, hopefully that makes sense there. Again, in terms of practicality, you never have to do this. But it's good to know that there's a signature there. And when you look at URLs, you know why that thing is there. Okay.
