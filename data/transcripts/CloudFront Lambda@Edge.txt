 Lambda Edge are Lambda functions to override the behavior of requests and responses for CloudFront. So here is a diagram of what that looks like. And so we have four possible functions we can override via Lambda Edge. The first is the viewer request when CloudFront receives a request from the viewer origin request before CloudFront forwards a request to the origin, origin response when CloudFront receives a response from the origin, viewer response before CloudFront returns the response to the viewer support languages here is Python and Node JS functions are deployed at the regional edge caches. This matters because it'll understand latency for these things. Okay, let's look at some use cases. So for your request, we could redirect HTTP to HPS, inspect cookies for user authentication, modify headers for a B testing. For view response use cases, we can add security headers set cookies for client side tracking customized error messages. For origin request use cases, we rewrite URLs for SEO or routing, inject headers for origin authentication, selective content serving based on user agent. For origin response use cases, we modify headers to control caching, update URLs and HTML, HTML versioning, customized error responses for origin. Some of these things don't make sense. Like I don't know if you need to redirect HTTP to HPS, because CloudFront can do that. But you can still use these functions to do that. Let's look at some examples here, each for one. So here for view requests, we are redirecting HTTP to HPS. Okay. So just trying to get you a bit familiar in terms of what this looks like. So here we have the request header, we see that it is HTTP. So we tell it 301. And we change that value there. Now we have adding security headers and actually a minute one, because there's just too many headers in here. But the idea is that we are adding specific headers here, okay, and then returning the response. Here we are modifying the origin requests to serve different versions based on the user agent, this is actually is very useful. So here we are looking at our requests. And then from here, we get the user agent. And we see if it's mobile, if it's mobile, we'll give the mobile URL, if not, it'll be the desktop. And then we have the origin response. So here we're changing a 404 to 200, which is useful. But again, this is functionality that CloudFront can automatically do for you. The idea is if we get a 404 return to 200 given, okay, and give it a custom page and some content type there. So there you go.
