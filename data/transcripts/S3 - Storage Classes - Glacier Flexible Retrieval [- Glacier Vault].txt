 s3 glacier flexible treble combines s3 and glacier into a single set of API's, and it's considerably faster than the glacier vault based storage. Let's unpack this because this is what the docs say. And it's a little bit confusing. Because sometimes when you read the best documentation, they're incomplete. Or they're just not well written. For the most part, they're really good. But as of late, and specifically with glacier, this one was really confusing for me. So it says formally s3 glacier. Now there is a service called s3 glacier, I like to call it glacier vault because it uses vaults instead of buckets. This still exists, it's not going anywhere, customers are still using it. Because if they were using glacier vault five years ago, they still have files that are locked in there. So it's not going away. And enterprises are going to continue to use it because they're used to it. So understand that that service isn't going anywhere. So when they say formally, they just mean that it is leveraging the technology underneath. And instead of using glacier vault, they would recommend that you use glacier flexible retrieval instead. I just want to point out how confusing the docs are at this time. Whereas when you try to read up on glacier vault, it will tell you to instead read about storage classes, and then storage classes will then point you back to glacier vault in a circle, and you'll get no information. It's great. So there are three retrieval tiers for glacier flexible retrieval, these are the same ones that you'd use for glacier vault, the faster they are, the more expensive they will be. So expedite is going to cost more than the other two here. This is when you need things in one to five minutes. And you only can grab 250 megabyte archive file sizes. For standard, there's no archive limit, but it's between three to five hours. And then for bulk, this is for five to 12 hours, there's no archive limit, it's going to be for petabytes worth of data, you're going to be charged for retrieval fee and the number of requests. And then there's the cost of storage. So, you know, similar to standard AI, there is also there's also an additional 40 kilobytes of data that is added with every single archived object. 32 kilobytes is for the archive index and metadata information that's so they know how to retrieve it, and stored and things like that. And eight kilobytes for the name of the object. I don't know if I put this in any of the other slides. But I'm pretty sure that eight kilobytes is always allocated for the name of an object even I think even for standard. But it only matters when you're retrieving data because you're you're paying based on the retrieved information. And so the thing that I need to point out here that's really important with glacier flexible, and this also applies for deep archive, I'm not going to talk about the next slide. But I want you to remember this is that you really should store fewer files and larger files in these storage classes. Because if you store 1000s of 1000s of files, it's going to add 40 kilobytes every single file, whereas if you take them and put them in a big zip file, it's only add 40 kilobytes to that large archive. And that's how you're supposed to use these classes. So just remember that caveat there, I'm going to point out that glacier flexible retrieval is not a separate service and does not require vault. AWS might be providing a managed vault underneath. We don't know we can't see it. But for your purposes, you just have to know that it has nothing to do with S3 glacier vaults. And you're going to be working with buckets even though probably is using vaults underneath.
