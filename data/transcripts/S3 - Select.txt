 s3 select lets you use structured query languages to filter the contents of s3 objects. So the idea here is let's say we have a CSV file, and we want to get particular information from it, we can use something that looks like well, it is it is an SQL expression. In order to grab data from that file, it only operates on a single file, it's going to work with data formats as CSV, JSON, or parquet. So those are all kind of structured data, so that you can use the structured query language against, it will also work on objects that are compressed. So if they're in a gzip, or a bzip, too, it'll work for those as well, but only for CSV or JSON objects, it works on objects that are server side encrypted as well. And you can get the results back in JSON or CSV. This feature is supported for very specific storage classes, reduce redundancy storage, they're obviously never going to support that because that is a legacy class for s3 Glacier flexible and deep archive. And also the same thing for the s3 intelligent tiering. They don't have them, but technically they do because there is a feature for Glacier called Glacier select, which is basically the same thing, but for those particular tiers. So yes, of course, Amazon s3 select does not work for those. But there's basically the same identical service within Glacier vault. And then this one, obviously, they support it because this is not built on the same technology as the ones below. One zone or Express one zones not here, because I have no idea if it's supported, because it's so new at the time making this video. And it has a different kind of exotic bucket type. So I'm not sure if that would affect its ability to work with this functionality here. But anyway, that's what Amazon s3 select does. And it's really useful if you have structured data, and you want to get it out of a very large file. So there you go.
