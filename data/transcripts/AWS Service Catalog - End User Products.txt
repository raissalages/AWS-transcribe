 Alright, so now we're going to take a look at the end user side when they're using a product. So an end user has a user friendly interface via the AWS console when opening up the service catalog, they also have an API. So if you really wanted to give your own skin, you didn't want to use the one that's part of the console, you can totally do so. But there are two things you're going to see you can see products and provision products. So you open up the catalog, there's a product, you're going to go ahead and launch that product. And then you can name it and choose the product version because you products have versions. And then you're going to fill in the parameters and parameters are just basically CloudFormation template parameters. But then you know, that's just what it is. And then what we can do is just before we launch the product, you can choose to create a provision product plan. And a plan includes a list of resources that will be created or modified before the product is launched. This might sound really familiar if you know cloud formation templates, which we'll talk about in a moment here, but you create a plan and then it says that it's been created. And so this is basically cloud formation chain sets, why it was called something else, I don't know, but that's what they do. And then once you have your product provision, there it is. And then you can get more details about it. And that's the information about the product. And then in the top right corner, we have some actions. And this is where we can actually add our own user defined actions, which we'll look at next called service actions.
