 VPC. It was site to site VPN allows you to connect your VPC to your on premise network. And so here is an example of a site to site VPN, you might see some illustrations a little bit different, but more or less, it is pretty much the same thing. But let's take a look at the components that are involved. The first is the VPN connection. So this is the secure connection between the VPC and the on premise equipment, you have your VPN tunnel, which is not illustrated here, but we'll see it in another slide as I did visualize it in another diagram. This is the encrypted connection. For your data, we have the customer gateway, the CGW, which provides information to AWS about your customer gateway device, we have your customer gateway device itself, this is the physical device or software application on your side of the site to site VPN connection, we have the target gateway. This is a generic term for the VPN endpoint on the Amazon side to the site to site VPN connection. So I suppose I'm just trying to look at our diagram because I don't see the target gateway in the diagram. But I suppose it's what you're targeting. Maybe that's within the virtual private gateway. Again, not the best at networking, but I know enough of this to get you through it. We have the virtual private gateway V G up g w. This is the VPN endpoint on the Amazon side of your site to site VPN connection that can be attached to a single VPC. Then we have transit gateway, which is not not in here. But the thing is, is that transit gateway is a newer service and can be used to utilize in a VPN. And we will we'll take a look at that. But let's just describe what transit gateway is. It's a transit hub that can be used to interconnect multiple multiple VPCs and on premise networks. And as a VPN endpoint for the Amazon side of the site to site VPN connection. And I think one of the reasons why you'd want to use a transit gateway as opposed to a VPN gateway is because VPN gateways only support ipv4. Whereas transit gateway support both ipv4 ipv6. But let's go look at more specific details. And this is going to be a very boring slide. But we'll get into the nitty gritty of the feature set for for site to site VPN, we have internet key exchange version two as the method of I guess encryption or whatever, we have NAT tread traversal, we have four byte asn in the range of what is provided there, we have two byte asn for the cgw. If you don't know what asn is, we describe it in one of the slides. We have cloud watch metrics, we have the reusable IP addresses of your customer gateways, you have additional encryption options, if you so choose to want to utilize them. We have custom private asn for the Amazon site for the BPG session, we support for ipv6 traffic for the VPN connected connections on a transit gateway. So that's that one I should have highlighted in red, because I think that's a very important indicator as to why you would use one over the other, you can optionally enable acceleration for your site to site VPN connection via the AWS global accelerator, you can attach a site to site VPN to AWS cloud when you can attach a site to site VPN to AWS transit gateway. In terms of pricing, you're going to be paying for each connection per hour, the data transfer out from the Amazon EC two instance to the internet is another cost that you could be incurring for limitations. It does not support ipv6 traffic for virtual private gateway. If you want ipv6, you're going to use transit gateway. AWS VPN connection does not support path mtu discovery, it's recommended that you do not use non overlapping cider blocks for your network. So for those who are not big into networking, you don't really need to remember all this that I think really matters is that ipv6 difference and the pricing here. But for those that aren't in networking, hopefully this was a value to you. So there you go.
