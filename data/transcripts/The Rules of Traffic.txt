 Let's talk about the rules of traffic for ELBs and just understand the components of how traffic flows. The first are listeners. So this these are for incoming traffic that is evaluated against listeners, listeners evaluate any traffic that matches the listeners port. Commonly, they listen on port 443, or port 80. So whether it is HTTPS or HTTP, for classic load balancers, EC2 instances are directly registered to the load balancer. We have rules. This is only available for application load balancers. I'm not going to say that there aren't rules for NLP. It's just that the rules, you don't change anything like there are rules, just a very simple rule and you can't, you know, there's no customization. Listeners will then invoke rules to decide what to do with the traffic. Generally, the next step is to forward traffic to a target group. But for ALBs, we have advanced rules around HTTP request information, which is only for ALB since it operates on the OS layer seven, I'm not sure why the sevens on the OS seven layer, let's write that back in there. There we go. target groups not available for classic load balancers are a logical grouping of possible targets such as a specific EC2 instance, IP addresses, CLB just directly associate targets to load balancer. So just here again, a diagram to show CLB there is no target groups, they just register them directly. But there you go. Okay.
