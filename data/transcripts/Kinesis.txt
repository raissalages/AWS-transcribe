 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And we are taking a look at kinesis. So Amazon kinesis is the AWS fully managed solution, well, mostly fully managed for collecting, processing and analyzing streaming data in the cloud. So when you need real time, think kinesis. And so examples of streaming data, you can utilize this for would be stock prices, game data, social network data, geospatial data, clickstream data. So anywhere where you have a large amount of data that you need to ingest and transform or do things with you can use kinesis streams. So there are four types of kinesis streams. The first is kinesis data streams. And this is a real time streaming data service allows you to configure custom producers and consumers and is the most flexible data stream option out of the kinesis line. The next one is Amazon kinesis data firehose, it used to be called kinesis firehose streaming service or whatever, but now they renamed it to just Amazon data firehose. And they call it new in the console, and they give it its own portal. But it's there's nothing different here. It's just marketing to uplift this product for its use case. But it's a simpler version of data streams, it is considered serverless, because you do not have to specify compute, not to say data streams does not have a serverless option, or fully managed option. But the idea here is that you just pay for what you consume here, it directly integrates with AWS services for its consumers. So it's often used with data streams, because data streams doesn't necessarily go directly to consumers. And you have to pipe into firehose to get to those consumers. So they're often used together. But it's a very simple way to deliver data to AWS services and mostly s3. Then we have managed service for Apache Finc. This was formerly known as Amazon kinesis data analytics. I think the rename was so that people understood that it was Apache Finc underneath so people could bring those skills over. This allows you to run queries against data that is flowing through your real time stream so you can create reports and analysis on emerging data. You definitely can use that with data streams. I can't remember if you can utilize that with firehose, I don't think so. But it's a service that you'd use in conjunction with data streams. Then you have kinesis video streams allows you to analyze or apply processing on real time streaming videos. And so those are the four major kinesis products. And you can see two of them have been renamed. So they're not really part of kinesis anymore, but they actually are. But there you go.
