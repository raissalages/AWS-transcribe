 at custom metrics and high resolution metrics. So you can publish your own custom metric using the AWS CLI or SDK. So you do AWS cloudwatch, put hyphen, metric hyphen data, you provide the the metric name, the namespace, the unit, the value and some dimensions, which are basically variables you're passing along. If you're doing the SysOps, the DevOps, you definitely want to know how to do this. For high resolution metrics, you can only switch to high resolution metrics when you are publishing a custom metric. So the standard resolution is one minute, but if you want it to report even more frequently, so under a minute, down to a second, you can use high resolution. With high resolution, you can track in intervals of one second, five seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds or multiples of 60 seconds. Okay, so there you go. All right.
