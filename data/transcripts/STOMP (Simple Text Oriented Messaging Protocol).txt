 stomp it stands for simple text oriented messaging protocol. It is a simple text based wire protocol that allows clients to communicate with almost any message broker stomp is so simple that it can be used with a telenet client. I've never done that. But that's what I'm told. stomp is interesting, because it just uses text, whereas other ones use a particular type of frame to transfer data and have other stuff wrapped around it. stop is very simple. But, you know, again, if you need something very simple, this is going to work as your use case. Here's an example of using stomp in Ruby. So very straightforward looks very similar to MQTT. And then there is us using stomp to subscribe. Out of all the protocols, MQP seems to be the most involved, but it has the most flexibility and stuff that can do. But yeah, there is stomp.
