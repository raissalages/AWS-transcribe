 Multi value answer policies let you configure Revit 3 to return multiple values such as an IP address for your web servers in response to DNS queries. Multiple values can be specified for almost any record. Revit 3 automatically performs health checks on resources and only returns values that have ones that are deemed healthy. So it's very similar to a simple routing however, with an added health check for your record set resources. So it's not just going to continually select ones that are incorrect. Notice looks very similar to simple simple routing where we have the resource records. But now we also have this multi value answer routing policy. And so it says evaluate target target health checks, but this actually should be turned to true and not false. Otherwise, what's the point right that it's not really working. So just notice that this they should have said true. I'm not sure why I have false in here. But yeah, there you go.
