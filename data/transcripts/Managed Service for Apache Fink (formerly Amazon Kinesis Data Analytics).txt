 for Apache Fink, formerly known as Kinesis Data Analytics, allows you to run queries against data that is flowing through your real-time stream, so you can create reports and analysis on emerging data. So you have your input stream, it goes to the data analytics, it goes to your output stream. Often you are chaining this with data streams and firehose. So this here could be, I'm trying to get my pen out here, so this here could be data streams, and this here could be firehose. Data that passes through data analytics is run through a custom SQL you provide, and the results are then outputted. Because this is Apache Fink, if you know how to use Apache Fink, you know how to use its service. If we decide to go deeper on this, I'll talk more about Apache Fink in particular, but this is all we need to know for now, that it is Apache Fink, and it lets you run custom SQL, okay?
