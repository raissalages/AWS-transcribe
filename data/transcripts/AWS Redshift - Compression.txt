 compression is something that is the most important thing in terms of speed. So redshift uses multiple compression techniques to achieve significant compression relative to traditional relational data stores. Similar data is stored sequentially on disk, it does not require indexes or materialized views, which saves a lot of space compared to traditional traditional systems. When loading data to an empty table data is sampled, and the most appropriate compression scheme is selected automatically. So this is all great information for the exam, you know, it's not so important to remember this, you know what redshift is utilized for these nitty gritty's at effort the associate is not so important.
