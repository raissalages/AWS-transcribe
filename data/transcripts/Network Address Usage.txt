 network address usage, also known as now's is a metric applied to resources in your virtual network to help you plan for and monitor the size of your VPC. Now's help you ensure you don't run out of room in your VPC by having this rough calculation that you are approaching max. I've never had to use now's but I imagine for enterprise architects that this could be a concern when you have a lot of resources. So this definitely could be something useful for enterprise architects. Now is represent specific resources as DAO units. We have a few examples here. So we have each. So we'll just go through the list here each IPV for address, I'll get the pen out so we can keep track where we are. Each IP IPV for address assigned to an E&I additional E&I is attached to the EC two instances, prefix assigned to a network interface, you can see a network load balancer has six now's VPC endpoint, crazy transit gateway attachment, a lambda function, a NAT gateway, and EFS attached to an EC two instance. I'm not sure why a lambda function is so heavy duty, but maybe when you associate it with it, there's a lot of stuff that's being added to do that. So extremely heavy, but that is what it is a VPC or peer VPC can handle a certain amount of now's. So understand, this is also going to change based on peering. So for the now limit, you have 64,000 now's, or you can also pronounce it knows, I don't know, and they use the edge to be saying any use instead, it sounds weird. Every time I say now's, if you are using, you can increase that quota right up to a quarter of a million, then if we're looking at peering, and by the way, this is shared for all the all the all the VPC is you're pairing with, you're looking at 128,000. So looks like more, but understand that it's going to be a lot more limited if you are appearing quite a bit. So we have 512 now's supplies to all VPC is in the pier. So that's what I'm talking about here. You can use now's to manually calculate when planning a VPC, you can use cloudwatch na you metrics to automatically keep track of na use, you need to enable any you monitoring on a VPC to collect metrics for cloudwatch. And that would be these particular metrics. So we have the network address usage over here, the uses period and the resource resources counted or resource count. You can enable this via this flag. In fact, I'm not sure if you can even do this through the CLI you might or sorry, through the UI, you might only be able to do this with a CLI, you can set a cloudwatch alarm to monitor those now's. And then you can see that specific metric tying back to there. Okay, so there you go. Ciao.
