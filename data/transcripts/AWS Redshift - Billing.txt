 for registered billing, the compute node hours, the total number of hours ran across all nodes in the billing period, build one unit per node per hour, and you're not charged for the leader nodes per hour. So when you spin up a cluster, and you only have one compute node and one one leader node, you're just paying for the compute node. For backups, backups are stored on s3, and your build the s3 storage fees, right. So you know, just same same thing as usual. And data data transfer build only only transfers within a VPC not outside of outside of it. Okay.
