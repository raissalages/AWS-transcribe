 Let us talk about classic load balancer. So this is anabuses first load balancer, it's a legacy one can balance HP, HP, HP S TCP, but not at the same time, it can use a layer seven specific features of the OS OSI models, which is sticky sessions, it can also use strict layer four for balancing purely TCP applications, not recommended use for anymore because we have specialized ones. It's really easy to configure and use. So I mean, it's not bad. But you know, this just says not to use it anymore. But we still got to talk about it. Because it still is used to show up in exams, not so much, but it's good to just get some of this knowledge here. Okay.
