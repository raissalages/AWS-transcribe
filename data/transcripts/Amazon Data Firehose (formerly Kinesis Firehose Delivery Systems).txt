 Amazon data firehose, formerly known as kinesis. firehose delivery system allows for simple transformations and delivery of data. And what's interesting here is that they renamed it. And they got rid of the word delivery system, which I thought was a really good name, because it really indicated as to what it did. But then for kinesis data analytics, they made it the name more obvious. So it's, it's weird that they do this. But clearly, there's different teams having different opinions here. And they're just changing things all the time on us. So here's our pipeline looks very similar to data streams, but notice that we do not see shards in the middle, we do not think about shards. And we have producers on the left hand side and then consumers on the right. We can use s3 redshift, elastic search, Splunk, there's a lot more than this. But the idea is that most of the time, things are going to either s3, or I suppose, redshift. So those are two that are really worth your time to spend or Splunk, I suppose that's a very common one as well. So you choose one consumer from the predefined list, you data immediately disappears. Once it's consumed, you can convert incoming data to a few other file formats, they compress and secure the data, you pay for data that is ingested. So this thing is super simple. But it is super awesome. And I've used it so many times for so many different use cases. So let's talk about sources. So sources, basically, here are the producers, okay, so they call the sources producers, and the destinations are the consumers, okay.
