 So one of the two types of cues that SQS has is the SQS standard queue. This allows you to nearly unlimited number of transactions per seconds. But as you can see, they're not in any particular order. The Inibus SQS standard queue guarantees that a message will be delivered at least once more than one copy of a message could potentially be delivered out of order, you need to ensure your consumers can process messages that arrive more than once and out of order, provides best effort ordering that that helps ensure a message is generally delivered in the same order that it was sent. So here's an example of us using a standard queue. And we are sending a message to the queue using the AWS SDK. This is a Ruby example, pretty simple, get my pen tool out here. So we can just make sure we're on the same page here. We have a message body, we send it here, we have our standard queue, we're sending it out there. By default, the standard queue is the default. Okay.
