 Alright, so memcache is an open source distributed memory object caching system. It's a caching layer for web apps. memcache is a key value store which supports strings, it can increment and decrement strings if they represent an unsigned 64 bit integer. That is the level of complexity we have here with memcache. It talks about objects, but objects are just string values. So they're not really any kind of complex data structure as it's implying, you can use various SDKs. Here's an example of using Ruby to use memcache. And the way you'd interact with it is telenet. If you want to directly interact with a server, there is no CLI tool. At least I didn't see one. So generally, these are your two options. Let's take a look at the commands. And these are all written in Python. So just understand the last examples, Ruby, these are in Python. So here we are showing us setting a value and you can set an expiration time for it or we'll use whatever the default is, you can get a value, you can delete a value, you can increment a value up and down if it's a number or an integer in particular, you can only add if the key doesn't key value doesn't already exist. And I say key actually should say just the key value to be whatever you pass along here, you can replace an existing key, you can flush all data, which means basically just delete everything you can supply a number if you want to delay that you can append or prepend string data to an existing value, you can get stats and I'm not showing it here, but there's actually a bunch of sub commands for stats about the cluster. So yeah, that's memcache. There you go.
