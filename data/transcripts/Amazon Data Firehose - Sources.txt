 So data firehose allows easily allows you to easily configure a source or sources of data, often with minimal or no programming skills. So I said earlier that the only you choose one in the UI, but technically, there could be multiple sources, because multiple services could actually deliver data just like data streams to your firehose. So technically, there's multiple sources. But when you're configuring it, it looks like you can only do one. So you aren't forced to learn Java to best utilize firehose, because you're just using the SDK. So here's an example of me using the SDK, and I'm just using put record, okay, if you need something that is, that is more proficient than put record, then you're basically putting data streams in front of it, okay. And then KPL is the one that's saying the stream and that one streaming to you, if that makes sense. So for sources, we have data streams that can send to firehose. I wrote firehose there, but it's I can't tell you how many times I wrote firehouse, firehose, firehose, sorry, data stream. So kinesis data streams can send to firehose, Amazon managed streaming for Kafka. So MSK can send there. But if you do choose MSK, the only destination is going to be s3. If you don't know what Kafka is, it's basically an open source alternative to kinesis data streams. We have direct put this is a very common way that you're going to be sending data over to firehose. And it supports many things, but specifically the SDK and CLI, which we utilize here, but you can see here, we have the SDK listed on the top. And we have a lot of services. A lot of these services are the same things that can directly send to data stream. So that's why I didn't do the full list there. Because you can kind of look at this one and get the same idea. Because these basically have integrations for how data is being delivered to firehose and also also to data streams.
