 Let's talk about the virtual private gateway component, which is important when you're setting up a site to site VPN. So it is a VPN endpoint, and it's on the Amazon side, and it can be attached to a single VPC. As you can see here, when you create your VJ gw, and I find the initialism always really hard to say there because it says virtual private gateway. So you think it'd be VPG, but it's not it's V gw, you need to assign an Amazon, an autonomous, that's a hard word to say, system number or an ASN or a custom ASN. And if you don't set one, it will always use the Amazon one, which is 64512. Okay, once you create your VGW, you cannot change the ASN. So you're going to be locked in with what it is. And you might be asking, what is this autonomous system number? Well, at ASN is a unique identifier that is globally allocated to each autonomous system that participates in the internet. So it's a way for your device to be detected as something to do with border gateway, border, big gateway, border gateway protocol. Okay, so, again, not super great at networking, but I know that is part of it. And that's all we really need to know about VGW is okay.
