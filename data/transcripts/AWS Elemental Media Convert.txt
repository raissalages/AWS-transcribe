 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And let's take a look at Amis Media convert, which is a fully managed video transcoding service that converts video from one format to another for video on demand or streaming video in addition to applying lots of additional processing options. So sounds very similar to last a transcoder, but it can do a ton of video correction, input filtering, and has a bunch of other features, like video cropping, video overlays, inserting messages, adding signaling, partner integrations, media convert, you define a job inputs and outputs media convert will pull videos from resource bucket transcode and place them into a destination bucket is a lot more to configure than elastic transcoder. And I know that is a spelling mistake. I'll, I'll fix that. Okay. But we do do a lab in both of them just so that we have our bases covered. So we know how they both work. And they're short labs. So yeah, there we go.
