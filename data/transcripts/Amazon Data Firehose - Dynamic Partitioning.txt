 For firehose, if you need to partition your data, and when we talk about partitioning, we're not talking about charge, we're talking about partitioning it at the at where we're going to store it, which is going to be s3, you can enable dynamic partitioning, which will continuously partition your data to s3 based on a prefix. So that's really useful. This makes it easier to run high performance cost efficient analytics on streaming data in s3, using various services such as Athena, EMR, redshift spectrum, quick site, this makes it also easier for AWS glue that can perform more sophisticated extract transform load jobs. To select the values and keys for partition, you have two ways inline partitioning, where you use jq expressions to parse JSON. Good thing I taught you folks jq in this course, so I told you it would come back in use. And then we have lambda function. So if you're not using JSON, you have a more complex data structure, then you have to pass it to a lambda to parse the values and return the key values. Once this feature is enabled, you cannot turn it off. That's why I have the permanent marker there to indicate that it's permanent once that's turned on. So imagine you have this JSON payload. Okay, the idea is that with the inline option, you choose your key, and then use the expression to choose the appropriate JSON that you'd need. And so basically, the partition is going to occur on those keys. Okay.
