 Hey, it's Andrew Brown. And we're taking a look at Amazon open search. And so this is a service that provides you a full text search service that makes it easy to deploy, operate and scale open search, a popular open source search analyst engine. But in particular, you actually can deploy open search or elastic search, it's just depending on what you want to do. When I did the lab, I was a bit confused because I knew that the service could do elastic search. But at the time, I couldn't remember what open search was. But now I remember, and this is back in 2021, was that a bus decided to fork the elastic search in kibana open source projects because the company called elastic had changed their licensing agreement. And so this, this move, I think was specifically so that it was would have to pay, it was like, Nope, we're just gonna fork them, and we're not going to pay. And so that's where open search came about. Elastic search is a search engine based on the Lucian library. So Lucy is something I've definitely used a lot in the past. So it's just an improved version of it. And if you go to the last six website, they still market this as free and open. And so again, the licensing was targeting large providers like it was to pay and they just worked around it. And you might have heard of the elk stack before these are three projects or pieces of software created by elastic, elastic search, log stash and kibana. And they're commonly used together so that you can basically have analytics and monitoring for your application. Think like log files, you could search. So think of the bare bones version of data dog that you can utilize for it. So elastic search would be your full text search and analytics engine log stash would be your data processing pipeline, a kibana, which I think I might have spelt wrong there key k i b, a note looks right, is your visualization layer. So it's basically the web UI so that you can quickly look at your data. But yeah, there you go.
