 special record type called record alias or record type. And the idea here is that if you set this to be a, then you can provide an alias target, and you can specify DNS name to a very specific database resource. And the reason why you'd want to do this, and it's preferred to do this, is because AWS will continuously monitor that the DNS endpoint, and it will, it will make it so that you don't end up with dead, dead routes. So if you're pointing to a DNS record, like always map, this thing will always map to the latest IP address if it changes. And so this is definitely preferable. But when you utilize it in AWS Management Console, you just like click through and it connects to it. But if you're using cross management accounts, like in another account, you can't just click and select it, you have to know the DNS name is and put it in there. So it's good to get some exposure to looking at what that looks like. These alias targets can point to CloudFront, Beanstalk, ELB, S3 website endpoint, research record set a VPC endpoint and API gateway endpoints for regional API's. So there you go.
