 traffic mirroring sends a copy network traffic from a source E&I to a target E&I or to a target UDP enabled network load bouncer or gateway load bouncer. So the whole point of this is that you can use traffic mirroring to send a copy of your traffic to something like a security monitor appliance. So imagine you have traffic coming in, it goes to the E&I and you say okay, now send it to the other E&I. And then we can analyze that traffic, you're going to notice that traffic mirroring is going to attach a VX Len header. If you want to know more about that it's in the docs. But all we need to know is that it's attaching an additional header for more information. For each packet, it's mirrored once for traffic mirroring, it allows you to apply filters. So you can filter based on a bunch of parameters, a mirror, a traffic mirror sessions need to be created to mirror the traffic. So that's these are the components you need to actually do this, you need to create a mirror source, a mirror target and a mirror filter. And that's about it. So there you go.
