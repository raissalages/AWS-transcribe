 So as three pre signed URLs provide temporary access to upload or download object data via URLs, and they are commonly used to provide access to private objects, the way we use pre signed URLs is that we're going to use them programmatically, I can't remember if you can make them the console, but the way you would want to use them is using the CLI, or very often, you're programmatically integrating them into your applications, and using the SDK to generate them out. So here's a very simple example of one that's going to expire after 300 seconds. And so once you input that, you're going to get back a very long link. And that is your pre signed URL, you can notice there's a lot of stuff going on in there. And that's okay. We'll take a look in the next slide. What's going on in this link.
