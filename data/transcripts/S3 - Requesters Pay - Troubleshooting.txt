 take a look here at requesters pay troubleshooting. So these are some things you need to consider with requesters pay. If you run into most issues, you're going to end up with a 403, which is a forbidden request. I just want you to know that so that you know, if you get an exam question that says, Hey, what happens when you run in an error with requesters pay, it's a 403. So this would happen when the requester doesn't include the parameter x, Amazon requestor pair, the request authentication fails. So something's wrong with the IAM role or IAM policy of the request is anonymous, which it cannot be it has to not allow that the request is a sub request. So requests are not allowed with requesters pay when turned on. And most of the time these days, we don't use soap. Soap is an older HTTP protocol or pattern for accessing data. And it's just not used anymore. So in the case of requester forgets to include the header, then a for through will occur, no charge will occur to the requester, no charge will occur to the bucket owner. So there you go.
