 A2S snowmobile is a 45 foot long rug rug ruggedized ruggedized ruggedized shipping container pulled by a semi trailer truck can transfer up to 100 petabytes per snowmobile. I'm not sure who's ordering multiple of these because they're so darn large. It was personnel will help you connect your network to the snowmobile. And when data transfer is complete, they'll drive it back to AWS to import into s3 or glacier. It has security features such as GPS tracking, alarm monitoring 24 seven video surveillance and escort security vehicle will while in transport is also optional. There it is. There's not much point in getting to the details of snowmobile because so few people are going to be utilizing it and there's not much to say just understand that it's handling 100 petabytes worth of data. So based on your use case, you know, you might want to consider this I believe it has compute on board as well. But there you go.
