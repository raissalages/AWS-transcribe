 s3 object lambda access points allows you to transform the output requests of s3 objects when you want to present data differently. And I should clarify that yes, it's doing transformations, but the original objects in the buckets are going to remain unmodified. Why would you want to do this, a very common use case would be you need to give a data sample set of production data or real data to a developer or someone in your data science team, but you don't want them to see the personally identifiable information or sensitive information. And so you can scrub that information out before they get it. So that would be a use case for that s3 object lambda can be performed on on the s3 operations of head of get and of list. And then obviously list objects, version two, those are just two different API endpoints, because for whatever reason, it was needed to make a tweak to list objects. And so they had a second version called version two. The idea of this is that you'll need to have an object lambda access point, which will attach the lambda function to your s3 bucket, multiple transformations can be configured per object lambda access point. So you can do a lot here, just to get a quick visualization. Just so you understand all the parts that are going on here, you have your bucket, you have your s3 object lambda, which attaches or attaches the lambda, and then you have the object lambda access point, which I believe goes to the object lambda to get to your s3 bucket. But it makes a lot more sense when we do it for real. But yeah, there you go.
