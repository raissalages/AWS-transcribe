 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And we are taking a look at Amazon personalized, which is a real time recommendation service. It's the same technology used to make product recommendations to customers shopping on the Amazon platform. Let's talk about all the components that go into building this, like basically the workflow, setting up Amazon personalized, because it's quite involved, and we do a lab on it. So first, you create a data set group, then you're going to create data sets. And they have three particular ones, a user item, interaction data, user data and item data, I believe user item, interaction data or user user interaction, item data, whatever you want to call it, the first one there is absolutely required where the other two are optional, you'll need to provide a JSON schema mappings for the CSV files. And all those files, there are CSV files, you will place these data sets in s3 and reference them that way, you'll have to create a solution recipe. Solutions help generate recommendations and recipes is the predefined AWS algorithm. So that's how it's going to actually do stuff, you have event tracking. So using the ingestion SDK, you can track events and also provide event information, you have filters, if you want to filter out certain items. For your recommendations, you have to create a campaign, this will create that production endpoint that you'll be able to utilize. Let's just take a closer look at the data. So you have your user item interaction data. So this is the core data set that is used to train a custom model is required for it to work, you have to have at least the user ID, the item ID and the timestamp, the timestamp hat timestamp has to be a Unix timestamp code. In the video, you'll see me trying to use the next timestamp, we had like a period following that which shows like milliseconds or microseconds, it can't be like that it has to be like it's shown here. Did you have your user data, pretty straightforward. The only thing that's required is a user ID, then you have your item data must include an item ID. If you need to have a category, it has to be called category l one for whatever reason, the docs are out of date, but I guess they have different levels of categorization now. So this graphic is incorrect, but it is category l one. Here's an example of us getting recommendations using the boto three Python library. This is something we do very similar in the actual lab itself. So pretty straightforward. You get the record recommendations, you'll pass the campaign on the user ID, and then the item ID depending on what recipe you're using or recommenders. But yeah, there you go.
