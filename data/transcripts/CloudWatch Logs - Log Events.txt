 Okay, so we looked at log groups, and log groups contain log streams. And then inside of a log stream, we have a log event. So let's look at log events. So a log event represents a single event in a log file. And a log event can be seen within a log stream. So that makes sense. So if you were to open up a log stream, here are a log events, each of those are each of those lines is a log event. And so what you can do is you're able to filter these log events with a simple pattern matching syntax. So if I wanted to just put in D, which stands for debug, possibly it will then pull out all the debug lines, or the log events that are for debugging, okay, but we'll look at some more richer options for filtering next with CloudWatch logs insights.
