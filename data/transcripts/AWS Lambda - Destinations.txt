 destinations. So destinations, we'll learn about this later on. But we have this idea of between sync invocations and async invocations. When lambda first came out, it was just synchronous invocations, which was the idea was that you would invoke a lambda, and it would immediately return a response generally HTTP response, because usually be using API gateway with it. But now we have this idea of async invocations, where the data is immediately returned to an async service. So the idea is here, we could have s&s, sq s lambda function, event bridge bus. So these are all services that are messaging systems or event driven systems. And you can have a destination to occur, whether there is a successful execution or a failed execution. We'll cover this again, when we talk more about sync versus async, in terms of how you can tune your
