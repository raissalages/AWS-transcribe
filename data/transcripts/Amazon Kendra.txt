 Kendra is an enterprise machine learning search engine service. It uses natural language to suggest answers to questions instead of using simple keyword matching. Instead of using key-based search, Amazon Kendra uses semantic and contextual understanding capabilities to search a query. It's like interacting with a human. In my experience, it wasn't really like interacting with a human, but this is what AWS describes it as. You can integrate with Amazon Lex Chatbot to utilize it as an interface for Amazon Kendra. Kendra has the following components. It has an index, data source, data source template schemas, a document addition API, though I found that I didn't really have to use that API in the labs. And the data source templates were really great ways of connecting different types of data source connectors because you can connect not from S3, but you can, but from SharePoint, Box, Postgres, basically any AWS storage service and third-party cloud storage services. So it really pulls in documents from places. I need to emphasize that word document because I was really surprised when I utilized this, that it was returning documents. I thought it was going to be a little bit smarter and be more like a bot, but basically you are uploading a bunch of documents. And I didn't list them here, but the format is document document, like PDF, EPUB, Word doc. It's not JSON. It's not things like that. So it will go through those documents and then return a document back to you with the section that it's found. So just understand that that's how it is going to return results. Kendra has two versions, which provides all features but with different limitations. When I did the lab, I forgot to specify the engine. And it turns out that Kendra defaults to Enterprise, which is really stupid. So make sure when you create it, especially with the CLI, you specify the engine version and set it to developers. And when you're watching me do the lab, stop and just watch a bit longer and see that I make that mistake. It's not going to cost you a lot, but it will cost you time. And I just want to save you some time here. So the Developer Edition has five indexes with up to five data sources each. The Enterprise has up to 50 data sources each. Both have 10,000 documents, 3 gigabytes of extracted text. Developer Edition has 4,000 queries at 0.5 per second. Enterprise has more. Developer runs in one AZ. Enterprise runs in three AZs. Developer Edition has a free tier with 750 hours for the first 30 days. I don't know why, but when you delete your Kendra index, it tries to ask you, why do you want to stop using it? And it's really unusual for an AWS service to do that. So I feel like PR really got involved in this product. So you'll create your index. You'll create your data source. Notice that I'm not specifying the engine there, but you really should in the index here. Sorry. So again, I'm going to say here, you need to specify engine and make sure it is developer. OK. Then we'll create our data source. If you are specifying data source, you're going to specify the type, and that's going to determine the connector it's going to use. And that connector will have some configuration. You can use template and then define your own schema there if you need to. OK. Once you create your index and data source, you will sync the data to your index, and then you can query for stuff. And that will return back documents, not super intelligent stuff. OK, so there you go.
