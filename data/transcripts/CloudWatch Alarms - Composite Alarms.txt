 let's take a look at composite alarm. So composite alarms are alarms that watch other alarms. And using composite alarms, you can reduce the alarm noise, that's the whole point behind them. So imagine you have two alarms, and you configure them to have no action. So you could set it on CPU and network in. So the idea here is you're going to create those two alarms. And when you go to configure the actions, you just choose nothing, you don't choose notifications, auto scaling groups or any EC two actions, they don't do anything. So they'll show up like this, where you'll see network in on the end there, the actions say no actions, and same thing with CPU utilization. So you select both alarms, and then what you can do is create a composite alarm. And then you can set an alarm condition. So there's a bit of logic there that you can use to do that. And then once you do that, you can go ahead and set a when it should trigger. But the thing is, is that it can only trigger an SNS topic, so it can only do a notification. But that's a way for you to reduce alarm noise and work with multiple arms. So there you go. All right, so now let's take a look at CloudWatch.
