 redshift availability. So redshift is single AZ super important to remember this, because a lot of services are multi AZ but redshift is not one of them maybe in the future, but maybe not. To run in multi AZ you would have to run multiple redshift clusters in a different AZ with with same inputs. So you're basically just running a clone. And it's all manual labor, right? So there's no managed automatic way of doing multi AZ snapshots can be restored to a different AZ in the event of an outage occurs.
