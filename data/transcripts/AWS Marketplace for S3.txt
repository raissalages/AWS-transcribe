 talk about the AWS marketplace for s3. So the AWS marketplace for s3 provides alternatives to AWS services that or they work with Amazon s3 to enhance the experience. And I just want to kind of get you exposure to some third party providers so that you have an idea of what is out there, at least by name. So let's break it down based on category. So for storage and back end recovery, we have services like FS FSX, for luster, tape gateway file gateway. And so third party providers here could be Veeam backup for AWS drew up for AWS backup and disaster recovery. We always always hear about Veeam all over the place. I imagine it's probably multi cloud. I haven't really had much experience with Veeam because I haven't had a use case for it. But I hear about it all the time. So Veeam is one name you'll want to remember data integration analytics transfer family data sync and Athena. So we have chaos search logs, IO byte flow enterprise edition. So this could be analyzing data, it also could just be log collection. So chaos search allows you to search across your s3 logs extremely efficiently. It's way more cheaper than a lot of other providers like data dog and things like that. So definitely a lot of options out there for observability monitoring, like cloud trail and cloud watch, you could use something like data dogs, Blanca, Dyna traces are the three that I know that are very popular for security and threat detection. We normally use guard duty or Macy. But you know, sometimes the rule sets and these things or the amount of security controls are not as powerful as we'd like them to be. So you could use trend cloud one or insight DB by our Dr. For rapid seven, or the VM series virtual next generation firewalls by Paulo Alto networks, because they've made that name any longer for permissions, we have I am so instead, you could use one login workforce identity file cloud EFS s, or your can three server, I think your can three servers just like a UI to access s3 in a more convenient way. One login is obviously an identity service. So it's more like if you're already using that it can integrate with it. But yeah, there's a lot of things in the marketplace to enhance the S3 experience. I just want to get you a bit of exposure with some of those third party names.
