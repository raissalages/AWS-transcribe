 instruction sets for lambda, and we have two available for us. The first is arm 64. And the other one is x 86. You'll hear me mention arm quite a few times, because it's important to know. The idea here is that an instruction set are a set of ops codes that represent operations the CPU can perform. So here are an example of ops codes. And the ops codes actually the stuff in red, it's not the load store add jumps subtract, that's what those ops codes do. But the idea here is that arm 64 has a smaller instruction set. Therefore programs built against arm are more efficient as a result are more cost effective for a program to run a specific architecture, the language, the programming language has to be turned into a machine language such as assembly code, which are those commands, you see LDA, SCA add, and those in turn are calling ops codes. And that's where your efficiency is coming from. So impossible use arm 64. Since it's more most proficient, all Amazon Linux to runtime support x 86 64. And arm CPU architectures. I don't know why the docs did not talk about Amazon, Amazon Linux 2023. But you know, I'm putting in here what I was able to find, okay.
