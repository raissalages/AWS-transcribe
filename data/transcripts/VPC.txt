 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And we are taking a look at AWS Virtual Private Cloud, also known as VPC. And this is a logically isolated virtual network. So it was VPC resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center. But a lot more easily done than I would say than a real data center as you're not managing all that hardware infrastructure underneath. And some things are simplified or abstracted away to make your life a lot easier. This is a diagram I created to represent a very simple VPC, I want to point out that these diagrams can get very complex, because there's a lot of components that go into VPC, depending on what you want to do. And you might only have room to represent certain things. So just understand that you're going to see a lot of variations here where some things are omitted, because they're assumed, and other times, they're adding more detail for specific reasons. So the VPC in here has, again, lots of different components. But generally, when you're using VPC, the two main reasons why is that you're launching a virtual machine, because that is the lowest kind of compute that you're going to get here. So here, it's represented here as an EC two instance, or a virtual network card, which are often attached to compute such as EC two. And so they're not always represented, I would say in in these diagrams, but those are network cards are very important. Because even if you're not using compute, you might need a network card to bridge some kind of other compute over into your VPC, whether that's lambda, or ECS, or any of these other managed compute services, or something like RDS. But generally, it's for EC two instances, but we'll get all into those components here shortly. AWS VPC is highly coupled with EC two. So all VPC CLI commands are under the AWS EC two. So just understand why that is because you know, you can't separate VPC from EC two, even though they're treated in the console as two separate things. Okay.
