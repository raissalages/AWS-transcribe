 going to take a look here at CloudWatch logs. And this is a service used to monitor, store and access your log files. But specifically, it is a centralized log management service. And it does a lot of things that has a lot of integration. So let's talk about them right now. The first is that you can export your logs to s3, so that you can perform custom analysis, maybe use Athena for that or some other service, you can stream your logs to elastic search service. So you can have full robots or robust full text search, or use the elk stack, you can stream CloudWatch events to CloudWatch logs. And this allows you to then analyze or leverage your CloudWatch or CloudTrail events just just as if they're CloudWatch logs. It's secure by default. So all the log groups are encrypted using SSC, you can use your own customer master key with AWS kms. So you have a bit control over there, you can do log filtering. So it has a filtering syntax. And CloudWatch logs has a sub service called CloudWatch insights, which we will cover in this section here. For log retention, all logs are kept by default indefinitely, and they never expire. But you can adjust adjust the retention period for each log group, keeping it indefinitely or choosing between one day and 10 years. And most services integrate with CloudWatch logs. Sometimes you have to turn some services on or require I am permissions to use CloudWatch logs, but more or less, AWS will do the heavy lifting for you to, you know, set those permissions and turn them on. So there you go.
