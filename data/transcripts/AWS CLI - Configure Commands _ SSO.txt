 So the CLI has multiple configure commands to make it easy to configure your configuration files. And this is generally the recommended way to generate all these files, you can create them by hand, but you know, you could use the wizard here as well. So the idea is you're going to type in a bus configure, it's going to prompt you for everything that you need to enter the access key, the secret, the default region, and your default output format, you can set a value for a specific setting by using the set command. So there, you're setting the region for the profile dev, you can unset a value by just providing a blank string, you can print out a specific value, if you want to see what your current configuration has, you can import it as credentials generated, that were generated out from the console. And this is a way for you to basically import without ever having to open the file and expose it. This could be very useful if let's say you are I don't know, a content creator, and you don't want to show off those credentials, and you want to import them. So that's kind of an example that I can utilize it for. You can list out your configurations, and you can list out your profiles, you can also log in via the, or you can configure, configure login for single sign on. I don't think I've ever done this before, because I usually avoid single sign on because I have to make a lot of videos that don't utilize it. And it's kind of a pain to turn on single sign on functionality and turn it off. I imagine that this is allowing you to bring your directory service and a bus or using maybe the I am identity center. But I just want you to be aware of that you can configure it with single sign on and large enterprises would probably appreciate knowing that. So that's why I'm sharing that here. Okay.
