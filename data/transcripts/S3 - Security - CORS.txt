 So within Amazon s3, you can set a course configuration for your bucket. And this is specifically for static website hosting. So then when you're trying to access resources from another domain, like let's say you're accessing JavaScript assets or something that you're going to be able to actually download them, execute them on the client side of your browser. So the idea is that this course configuration file can be in either JSON or XML. In the database console, it only shows JSON. And this XML used to be in the console that got rid of it. It suggested that you can still set it. But when you look at it with CLI, you're only still showing JSON options. I know it used to be XML, but I can't find a way to upload XML anymore. This stuff is pretty standardized. It's not specific to AWS, when you're configuring cores, the XML will always pretty much look the same. But let's take a look on the right hand side and see what we are doing. So we're saying allow all headers for put, post and delete methods for this specific origin. And then the next one we're saying for allow all headers for put, post delete for this other domain, so that we could be getting resources from these two different locations. And then down below, we're saying, we're not specifying any headers to be allowed, but we're saying, let's get let's, let's be able to get anything from anywhere. And generally, you don't want to use this asterisk here for the wildcard, as it would negate the protection of cores, because you'd be saying, hey, I don't want to have any cores protection. But a lot of times in development, you will set this. And then once you have cores working, you'll narrow it down and make sure it works. So I just would say in production, you would not necessarily want to have a wildcard there. But yeah, there you go. Hey, this is
