 Pro and we are looking at Amazon Redshift, which is a fully managed petabyte size data warehouse. So what we use a data warehouse for, we would use it to analyze massive amounts of data via complex SQL queries. Amazon Redshift is a columnar store database. So to really understand what Redshift is, we need to understand what a data warehouse is to understand what a data warehouse is, it's good to compare it against a database. And understand this, we need to set some foundational knowledge and understand what a database transaction is. So let's define a database transaction. A transaction symbolizes a unit of work performed within a database management system. So an example of a transaction or reads and writes, that's as simple as that. And for database and data warehouse, they're going to treat transactions differently. And so for a database, which we have an online transactional processing system, an OLTP, the transactions are going to be short. So look at the bottom here, we say short transaction. So that means small and simple queries with an emphasis on rights. Okay, so why would we want short transactions? Well, for OLTP, well, a database was built to store current transactions, and enables fast access to specific transactions for ongoing business processes. So they're just talking about I have a web app, and we need to be very responsive for the current user for reads and writes. Okay, and so that could be adding item to your shopping list, that could be sign up that could be doing any sorts of thing in a web application. And generally, these are backed by a single source. So a single source would be post grass on could be running on RDS. And so that's the idea behind a database. So if we go over to the data warehouse side, it runs on an online analytical processing system on old lap, and old laps are all about long transactions. So long and complex SQL queries with an emphasis on reads. So a data warehouse is built to store large quantities of historical data, and enable fast and complex queries across all data. So the utility here is business intelligence tools generating reports, and a data warehouse isn't a single source it is it takes data from multiple sources. So DynamoDB, Mr. s three, Postgres all over the place data is coming into one place so that we can run complex queries and not too frequently. So now that we know what a data warehouse warehouse says, let's talk about the reasons why you'd want to use redshift. So redshift, the pricing starts at 25 cents per hour with no upfront costs or commitments. It scales up to petabytes, petabytes of data for $1,000 per terabyte per year. Redshift is priced less than one tenth the cost of most similar services. Redshift is used for business intelligence. Redshift uses old lap redshift is a columnar store database. And this is the second time we've mentioned this. And we really need to understand what a columnar storage database is to really understand the power behind redshift and data warehouses. So columnar storage for database is database tables is an important factor in optimizing an analytic query performance because it drastically reduces the overall disk IO requirements and reduces the amount of data you need to load from the disk. So columnar storage is the reason why redshift is so darn fast. And we're going to look at that in more detail here. So let's really cement our knowledge with redshift and show a use case example. So here I have I want to build my own business intelligence tool. And I have a bunch of different sources. So I have data coming from EMR, I have data coming from s3, I have data coming from DynamoDB. And I'm going to copy that data. However, I want to there's a copy command, I'm going to copy that data into redshift. Okay, so but once that data is in there, you say, well, how do I interact and access redshift data? Normally, you know, most services use the AWS SDK, but this came case, we're not using AWS SDK, because we just made you need to make a generic SQL connection to redshift. And so if we're using Java, and generally, you probably will be using Java, if you're using redshift, you'd be using j, JDBC, or od BC, which are third party libraries to connect and query redshift data. So I, you know, I said columnar storage is very important to redshift performance. And so let's conceptually understand what that means. So what will we normally use with a database would be reading via the rows, whereas in in an old lap, we're reading versus columns, because if we're going to be looking at a lot of data and crunching it, we it's better to look at it at columns, okay, because that way, if we're reading columns, it allows us to store that data as the same data price for data type for allow for easy compression, that means that we're going to be able to load data a lot quicker. And because we're always looking at massive amounts of days at the same time, we can pull in only the columns that we need in bulk, okay. And so that's going to give us much faster performance for our use case, which is like business intelligence tools.
