 FSX for Windows File Server is a fully managed shared storage built on Windows Server. It has native support for Windows File System, SMB, native Windows compatibility, enterprise performance and features, consistent sub-millisecond latencies, tools that Windows developers and administrators use today and can continue to work on change, offers storage backed by SSD, HDD, or both. I think it's hard to describe. Yeah, HDD. FSX integrates with your Microsoft Active Directory. Amazon FSX can be used for business apps, home directories, web serving, content management, data analytics, software build setups, media processing workloads. To run FSX, you'll need an EC2 instance, a workspace instance, an AppStream 2.0, or VMware Cloud on AWS. There should be an asterisk on that because I don't know the state of VMware these days, as they were acquired by BroadCam, Broadband, whatever they're called. The reason you should know this one is because for storage gateway file storage, you have file storage for FSX for WFS, and so that's that integration there. So I'm just trying to get you a bit more familiar with this. It's probably not easy to configure. It's a Windows File Server, or file storage. So, the Windows, totally out of scope here, going into detail here, but we should overall know what these things do, okay?
