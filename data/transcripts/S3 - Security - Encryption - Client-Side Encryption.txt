 let us talk about client side encryption for s3. So this is when you encrypt your own files before uploading them to s3. This provides a guarantee that AWS and no third party can decrypt your data, I want to make a distinction here between this and SSC hyphen C where you're generating out a key. But the difference is that KMS is the one server side that is decrypting it. Whereas in here, there's no server side decryption happening. Okay, it's all client side. So there are various AWS SDKs that have built in code to make it easy to encrypt your data. Here's an example with Ruby, I've looked at all the different SDKs, some are much easier than others. But the idea here is that we are requiring open SSL, we did this kind of before with SSC hyphen C, where we use bash terminal to use open SSL to generate a key. So we generate a new key here. And then we're configuring it globally for the s3 client. So that anytime we do a put or get, it's going to automatically use that key. And so here, we have a key and a bucket. And then we provide some data. So this is the secret data. And notice we put the object, so we send it to s3. And then we do a get object, when we read it, it's going to decrypt the data. But I need to make the distinction here that this is happening client side, this, this key never went to a bus, it just stayed on your computer. And it's just here in the configuration, if you were to create a new client, so this configuration here is not going to be applied, then it's just going to return the ciphertext because that's what it is without the key and you don't decrypt it, you just get a ciphertext back. So there you go.
